Heck, the technology is only what? 1,000 years old?\\n\\nYou can learn how to build a deyhdrator very easily from the book, \"The\\nHungry Hiker\\'s Guide to Good Food,\" by Gretchen McHugh.  The heat source\\nis a 100 watt light bulb.  Basically, it\\'s a vertical wooden box with\\nventilation holes in the top and bottom (lots of them, you want the air\\nto flow).  The light bulb goes in the bottom, and wire cake racks are\\nspaced every 6\" starting about 10\" above the bulb.\\n\\nOr, at a slightly higher cost in electricity, you can do what I do:  Use\\nyour oven.  (NOTE - I do this in an electric oven; some gas ovens may\\nnot have a low enough setting).  Put food to be dried on cookie tins or\\nracks in the oven.  Set oven to 140 degrees (the lowest setting on my\\noven - if yours goes down to 120 that\\'s probably even better.)  Stick a\\nwooden spoon or something across the front corner of the oven and close\\nthe door on the spoon so that it stays open about an inch - this allows\\nfor airflow.  Leave the stuff in the oven for 6 to 8 hours; check it\\noften, since this dries it much faster than the dehydrator.  If you are\\nusing cookie sheets instead of racks, turn the stuff over halfway\\nthrough.\\n\\nIf you want more info, e-mail me since this isn\\'t really the right sub\\nfor this stuff.\\n\\ngerald.belton@ozonehole.com\\n\\n\\n * SLMR 2.1 * I still miss my boss, but my aim is improving.\\n                       \\n----\\nThe Ozone Hole BBS * A Private Bulletin Board Service * (504)891-3142\\n3 Full Service Nodes * USRobotics 16.8K bps * 10 Gigs * 100,000 Files\\nSKYDIVE New Orleans! * RIME Network Mail HUB * 500+ Usenet Newsgroups\\nPlease route all questions or inquiries to:  postmaster@ozonehole.com\\n',\n",

The whole tenor of this\\nrelease seems to be establishing a ground rule that only \"business\" use\\nis legitimate for debate. If you want the nothings you drop in your wife\\'s\\near to remain secret and private, that is not even on the agenda for debate.\\nNote that there is NO role for you to contain private info in this. The only\\nreference is to information already in the hands of others. The \\'unauthorized\\nrelease\\' bit is also drawing a long bow. Most of these cases are by people who\\nhave legitimate access abusing it, and revealing, or often selling the info.\\nThese people are, of course, in this proposal, the people who will have the\\nkeys.\\n\\nThe criminals also use lawers, courts, the CIA, white-house officials and pens\\nto go about their business. When will they be outlawed as well? Yeah, several\\nof them would be a better idea than CLipper!\\n\\nThem again, the protections of law and the courts have been seriously erroded\\nover the last decade ofr so.\\n\\n> A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"Clipper Chip\" has\\n> been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a\\n                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nNSA\\n\\n> new approach to encryption technology.\\n\\nYeah, this bit is VERY true.\\n\\n>....It can be used in new,\\n> relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\\n> an ordinary telephone.

A demo\\nof the above claim on an ordanary POTS would be a good nights entertainment\\nI suspect. Note also the \\'many\\'. not \\'all\\', as the general tone implies.\\n\\n> This new technology will help companies protect proprietary\\n                                ^^^^^^^^^\\n> information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations\\n                                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n> and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted\\n> electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the\\n> ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to\\n> intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. \\n\\nThe case record seems to indicate that what is needed is a brutal tightening\\nof the current abuses. I have not heard, yet, of a case that was impeaded by\\nthe use of secure encryption by the men in black. The other side, abuse by law\\nenforcers is well documented, even by govt agencies. And the phone vs other coms\\nis blurred yet again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n> A \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the\\n> \"Clipper Chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding\\n> Americans.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n> A \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the\\n> \"Clipper Chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding\\n> Americans.\\n\\nLets run that line twice. Not **VERY** carefully what it says. The stated\\npurpose of the key eschrow is to make the use of Clipper compulsory. Note the\\nword \"ensure\". As to \\'protect\\', or \\'law-abiding\\', I will leave to you.\\nSo to the person who asked if it included the outlawing of other encryptions,\\nthe answer in this press release is, YES.\\n\\n> ...Each device containing the chip will have two unique\\n> \"keys,\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government\\n> agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the\\n> device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately\\n> in two \"key-escrow\" data bases that will be established by the\\n> Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to\\n> government officials with legal authorization to conduct a\\n> wiretap.\\n\\nJust as they only can wiretap now with a warrent. \\n\\n> The \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with no\\n> new authorities to access the content of the private\\n> conversations of Americans.\\n\\nJust makes sure that the illegal ones are preserved.\\n\\n> To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the\\n> Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new\\n> devices.

Any ex KGB people looking for a contract? :-)\\nAnd as a later posting asks, what of the STU-IIIs they already have. It will\\nbe very interesting to see if the military and US embasies start to use it.\\nAfter all, it is secure, isn\\'t it. The govt will answer that point by its own\\nactions.\\n\\n> The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of\\n> encryption\\'s dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the\\n> privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield\\n> criminals and terrorists.

The Administration is committed to policies that\\n> protect all Americans\\' right to privacy while also protecting\\n> them from those who break the law.\\n\\nEncryption and codes have been around for millenia. They are generaly in\\nequilibrium with the technology of the time. The systematic study of cyphers\\nhas resulted in a swing in favor of the encrypter, AT THE MOMENT.

What would they have to do to\\n>      decipher the message?\\n> \\n> A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\\n>      court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They\\n>      would then present documentation of this authorization to\\n>      the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and\\n>      obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug\\n>      smugglers.

At this point, the Department of Justice and the\\n>      Administration have yet to determine which agencies will\\n>      oversee the key-escrow data banks.\\n\\nIt is a little hard to critisise a non-proposal.\\n\\n> Q:   How strong is the security in the device?

While the algorithm will\\n>      remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow\\n>      system,\\n\\nThis link between the security of the key-eschrow, and the actual algorithm is \\na real winner.

This approach has been endorsed by the\\n>      President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet\\n>      officials.\\n\\nQuick, with out looking back, What name is missing from that list?\\n\\n> Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?\\n> \\n> A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on\\n>      encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify\\n>      as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have\\n>      briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the\\n>      decisions related to this initiative.\\n\\nThe people who agree with us and who think there is a buck in it for them.\\n\\n> Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?\\n> \\n> A:   The government designed and developed the key access\\n>      encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the\\n>      microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product\\n>      manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip\\n>      manufacturer that produces them.\\n\\nThe reverse engineering provisions of the \\'Mask-work\\' act could be relevent\\nhere.\\n\\n> Q:   Who provides the \"Clipper Chip\"?\\n> \\n> A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,\\n>      California, and will sell the chip to encryption device\\n>      manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed\\n>      to other vendors in the future.\\n> \\n> Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? \\n> \\n> A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating\\n>      the \"Clipper Chip\" into their devices.\\n\\nYou don\\'t. Not unless you are one of the \\'right people\\'.\\n\\n> Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological\\n>      solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be\\n>      willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more\\n>      powerful encryption devices?\\n> \\n> A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be\\n>      considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow\\n\\nThey missed the word secret here. He needs a grammar lesson too.\\n\\n>      mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product\\n>      that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive\\n>      than others readily available today, but it is just one\\n>      piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to\\n>      encryption technology, which the Administration is\\n>      developing.\\n\\nI would say \"less secure, less conveniant, more expensive ( PGP is free ),\\nless available, and more prone to being comprimised\"\\nProofs to the contarary will be welcome. Note PROOF.\\n\\n>      The Administration is not saying, \"since encryption\\n>      threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,\\n>      we will prohibit it outright\" (as some countries have\\n>      effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \"every\\n>      American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an\\n>      unbreakable commercial encryption product.\"\\n\\nThey don\\'t seem to be saying anything that makes much sense. And this proposal\\nDOES prohibit it except in a very limited way. And, this is the one explicit\\nreference to personal rights. It is a denial. And yes, I don\\'t think that the\\nMexicans, Brazilians, and Canucks are included in Clinton et als magnanamous\\ngesture.\\n\\n> ...  There is a\\n>      false \"tension\" created in the assessment that this issue is\\n>      an \"either-or\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,\\n>      and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,\\n>      balanced approach such as is proposed with the \"Clipper\\n>      Chip\" and similar encryption techniques.\\n\\nThe \\'false tension\\' is false. The balance is between two repugnant points. The\\nRIGHT to privacy is hand-waved to non-existance by putting it behind the \"false\\nassessment\". It is assumed that the removal of the right to take what ever steps\\nYOU deem suitable to protect YOUR privacy is non negotiable, hence is defined\\nin the govenment language to be non-existant. If you don\\'t agree, you must be a\\ncriminal, as only criminals don\\'t agree with out laws. Also note the non-\\nquestion. \"If what is here was not possible...\"\\n\\n> Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton\\n>      Administration\\'s policy toward encryption will differ from\\n>      that of the Bush Administration?  \\n> \\n> A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption\\n>      technology in telecommunications and computing and are\\n>      committed to working with industry and public-interest\\n>      groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans\\'\\n>      privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law\\n>      enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime\\n>      and terrorism.\\n\\nIt indicates we know that Bush dropped the ball in squashing that nasty < insert\\nsuitable retoric > and will stamp out this disorderly, unruley outbreak of\\nfreedom and ultra-national sentiment.\\n\\n> Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use\\n>      the government hardware?\\n> \\n> A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control\\n>      requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is\\n>      required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The\\n>      same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the\\n>      attractions of this technology is the protection it can give\\n>      to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this\\n>      in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a\\n>      case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these\\n>      devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan\\n>      to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability\\n>      of these products.\\n> \\n\\nThis one is a real giggle. In Australia or France, they will have to reveal the\\nkeys, and the algorithm. Don\\'t think it\\'s at the top of my list of things I must\\nhave, so the restrictions will protect me from saleks trying to sell me a bill\\nof crock.\\n\\nAny for any others using it, they must be nuts!\\n\\nGood luck folks.\\n\\n~Paul\\n\\n',\n",

Features\\n===========\\n\\nDMPEG/DMPLAY is another MPEG decoder/player for the PC:\\n\\n\\n - decodes (nearly) the full MPEG video standard\\n   (I,P,B frames, frame size up to at least 352x240 supported)\\n\\n - saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display\\n\\n - optional on-screen display during decoding (requires VGA)\\n\\n - several dithering options: ordered dither, Floyd-Steinberg, grayscale\\n\\n - color-space selection\\n\\n - runs under DOS, 640KB RAM, no MS-Windows required\\n\\n - very compact (small code / small data models, 16 bit arithmetic)\\n\\n - real time display of the raw file by a separate player for\\n   VGA and many Super-VGAs\\n\\n...\\n\\n4. Technical information\\n========================\\n\\nThe player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [1].\\nThe IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [2]\\n(not quite the optimum, I know). Blocks with not more than eight non-zero\\ncoefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT\\n(sounds great, doesn't it?), which turned out to be faster than a 'fast'\\nalgorithm in this (quite common) case. Dithering is pretty standard. Main\\ndifference to the Berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supported\\nalgorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors, the (default) option to\\nuse a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturation\\ndominant ordered dither. This leads to a significantly superior quality of\\nthe dithered image (I claim, judge yourself).\\n\\nRestricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to\\n+/-0.25 (instead of +/-0.5) and the display color-space points are distributed\\nover this restricted space. Since the distance between color-space points\\nis thus reduced by a factor of two, the color resolution is doubled at the\\nexpense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors.\\n\\nSaturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color, lying\\nsomewhere between the points of the display color space, is approximated\\nby primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of\\nconstant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality due to the\\nlower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than\\nto hue changes (the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improve\\non NTSC). The improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redish\\nareas.\\n\\n...\\n\\n--\\nStefan Eckart, stefan@lis.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de\\n\",\n",

(Of course these could all be\\nwrong.....) \\n\\nfrom \\n\\n                     THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY\\n                               Dorothy Denning\\n                           Revised, April 21, 1993\\n\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n\\nThe Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block\\nencryption algorithm called \"Skipjack.\"  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys\\n(compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling\\n(compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of\\noperation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in Electronic\\nCodebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second.\\n\\nEach chip includes the following components:\\n\\n   the Skipjack encryption algorithm\\n   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips\\n   N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change)\\n   U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip\\n\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n\\nENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP\\n\\nTo see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T\\ntelephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and\\nwe both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure\\nconversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K\\nwith the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes place\\nwithout the Clipper Chip.  In general, any method of key exchange can\\nbe used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method.\\n\\nOnce the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to\\nencrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The\\ntelephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two\\nvalues:\\n\\n   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and \\n   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field , \\n\\nwhich are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement\\nfield thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U\\nconcatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family\\nkey F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after\\nan authorized wiretap has been installed.\\n\\n------------------\\n\\nsuppose i knew how the algorithm worked and knew the N for my chip, but\\ndid not know F, then by cryptanalysis i might be able to determine F from\\nif law enforcement field \\n   E[E[K; U] + N; F]\\nnot knowing N would might make this much harder.\\n\\nNow suppose that I know F, (either legitimately or not),\\nIf I know K (either because I am involved in the conversation, or I know U\\nfor a party in the conversation), I may now be able to determine U for the\\nother party.\\n\\nIf I know F I can also defeat the law enforcement field, since I could\\nmake my own, with a different K then the one I am using. Knowing F also\\nallows traffic analysis to be performed. So I might not know what you are\\nsaying but I could know who you are saying it too.\\n\\nNow I admit that someone trying to compute U will not have lots of\\nmessages to work from, but since we have no way of knowing that the key\\ngeneration method does not (deliberately?) generate weak keys, or for that\\nmatter that the published method is in fact used, perhaps the U\\'s will be\\nchosen from know weak keys for the system.\\n\\nObviously the compromise of F would be a disaster, both to law enforcement\\nfor whom this whole thing is designed, and for the people who believe that\\nit is giving them security. F is but one number, and I sure that alot of\\npeople (more then 1) know what it is (and if some \"panel of experts\" is\\ngoing to check it over for flaws then many more will know F, forget\\ngrinding chips, bribery and blackmail work just fine.\\n\\nSo, am I wrong? Or are these problems.\\n\\njon\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'From: schmidt@auvax1.adelphi.edu\\nSubject: Grounding power wiring, was Re: a question about 120VAC outlet wiring\\nLines: 163\\nNntp-Posting-Host: auvax1\\nOrganization: Adelphi University, Garden City NY\\n\\nThere has been quite a bit of discussion about house wiring and grounding\\npractices here.  A few points need to be clarified:\\n\\nThe Equipment GROUNDING conductor, Green, green with a yellow stripe, bare, or\\nthe metal sheath or pipe of SOME wiring methods, is used as a safety ground, to\\ncarry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel, and to limit the\\nvoltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects.  It\\nshould never (except for a few exceptions to be discussed later) carry the\\nnormal operating current of a connected load.  Some equipment has filters in\\nthe power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding\\nconductor.  \\n\\nMuch communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages\\non the grounding conductor, and may require special wiring of the grounding\\nconductors to provide reliable operation  (\"orange\" outlets are often used for\\nthis, with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box, and in\\nmany cases back to the service.  Anyone installing such a system should read\\nboth the section on grounding in the National Electric Code and publications on\\ninstalling quiet isolated ground systems.  The code requires the insulated\\ngrounding conductors (green wires) to run with the current carrying conductors\\nback to the panel box, and, if required, back all the way to the service\\nentrance , where it is bonded to the service ground (water pipe or rod)  Many\\nof these systems are installed illegally or unsafely, where they do not provide\\na safe ground or a quiet ground or either. \\n\\nThe GROUNDED conductor of a circuit, often called the NEUTRAL, which is\\nreferred to in the code as the \"identified\" conductor and is supposed to be\\nwhite or natural grey.  This conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in\\nmost electrical systems at a single point, generally at the service entrance\\npanel.  This connection is through the Main Bonding Jumper.  (In many household\\nservice panels, the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which\\nattaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel)  \\n\\nThe Grounded conductor (neutral) is generally a current carrying conductor.  In\\nthe case of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the\\ncircuit from the panel to the load device.  \\n\\nSince the grounded conductor (neutral) is only connected to the grounding\\nconductor (bare or green) at the service entrance, if the load is any distance\\nfrom the service and draws any significant current, there will be a small but\\nmeasurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load,\\nunder normal operating conditions.  If you should (incorrectly) connect the\\ngrounded (neutral) conductor to the grounding conductor at the load, some of\\nthe neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor.  Since\\nthere will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor, it will also\\nno longer be quite at ground potential at the load end.  If the load equipment\\nhas a metal case, which is connected to the grounding conductor through the \"U\"\\nground plug, the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential. \\nThe difference (under normal, non short-circuit conditions) may be only a few\\ntenths of a volt, but it could also be a volt or two.  This normally does not\\npresent a shock hazard.  \\n\\nHOWEVER, if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact\\nwith an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe, a radiator,\\na metal air conditioning duct or such, part of the neutral current will try to\\nflow through this aalternate ground path.  If the contact is not solid, you\\nwill get a significant arc (a low voltage, but possibly moderate current arc)\\nUnder the wrong conditions, this arcing could start a fire.  It is possible in\\nsome cases that the sneak ground current   could also flow through a wire of\\ninadequate size, causing it to overheat.\\n\\nWith the incorrect non single-point grounding of the neutral, if there is a\\nshort circuit from hot to neutral, the high short circuit current which may\\nflow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor, which\\nincreases the possibility for shock or fire.  \\n\\nAlso if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground, the voltage on\\nthe ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment, often\\ncausing malfunction.  I have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in\\ntechnical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment.\\n\\nThe Neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as\\nwell as at the service entrance of each dwelling.  This is done primarily for\\nlightning protection, so that induced lightning currents have a short path back\\nto ground, and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded\\nobjects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses\\nquickly.  The bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the\\ndwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer.  Some of it\\nflows through the grounding electrode (water pipe, etc.) this may cause\\ncorrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks,\\nand it may also cause measurable AC magnetic fields due to the large loop\\nbetween the \"hot\" conductors in the service and the neutral current in the\\nwater pipe and ground.  There are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy. \\n(don\\'t flame ME on this, I\\'m just telling you where the field comes from, not\\nit\\'s health effect, as far as I\\'m concerned, the jury is still out on this.)\\n\\nNote that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel, NOT at any\\nsub distribution panels.  This is one reason why it is illegal to run service\\nentrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel, you must have\\na seperate insulated conductor for the neutral.  The sheath can be used in this\\napplication only as the groundING conductor.  If the neutral is bonded to the\\ngrounding conductor in the sub panel, say by forgetting to remove the bonding\\nscrew, all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above\\nground, with the possible problems listed above.\\n\\nThe code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers, as well as feeds from one\\nbuilding to another.  In the cases of the range and dryer, the neutral may be\\nused as the equipment ground under certain conditions, instead of a seperate\\nwire.  Every time the code is revised, these exceptions come up for review. \\nThese exceptions were, in fact the first required safety grounds, in the days\\nbefore U ground outlets and such.  The appliance manufacturers don\\'t want to\\nhave to redesign their ranges and driers, and the contractors don\\'t want to\\nhave to run four wire cable (with four fairly heavy, expensive wires) in place\\nof three wire to the appliances.  No question it would be safer with seperate\\nneutrals to the stove, but the neutral current is low for most burner settings\\n(since most current is in the 220 volt \"hots\" except at some low settings, the\\nwires are large gauge, and there are few reported cases of injury or damage. \\nSo far, the exceptions have survived. In the case of feeds between buildings,\\nit\\'s primarily for lightning protection.\\n\\nPeople doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn\\'t a legal grounding\\nconductor.  Obviously, the bare wire in \"romex\" \\'with ground\\' is.  Anywhere\\nthere is a green wire installed, such as in a portable cord, that is a good\\ngrounding conductor.  The sheath of BX clamped in BX connectors in metal boxes\\nis a legal grounding conductor (in the US). (BX has an aluminum band run under\\nthe steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath.  You can just cut this\\naluminum band off at the ends, you don\\'t have to bond it to anything, it does\\nits job by touching every turn of the BX sheath.) Conduit or EMT (thinwall\\ntubing) is generally a legal grounding conductor, but may require a bonding\\nlocknut where it enters a box or panel, particularly for larger pipes.  \\n\\n\"Greenfield\" (looks like big BX, but you pull your own wires in the empty\\nsheath after you run it) is NOT a legal grounding conductor, as it doesn\\'t have\\nthe aluminum band to bond it, and the spiral steel has too much resistance and\\ninductance.  You have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the\\ngreenfield.\\n\\n\"Wiremold\" is also not a legal grounding conductor, as the paint on the boxes\\noften prevents good contact, and the \"feed\" to the wiremold extension is often\\nfrom a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold\\nbox.  I have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and\\nthe cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were \"hot\" with\\n120 volts (Why do I get a shock every time I touch my computer and the radiator\\nhere in the office?) because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one\\nof the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box.  You must run a\\nground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in\\nthe original wiring (conduit, BX, etc.) where you can \"bond\" the wire to the\\nbox with a screw, bnding clip, or whatever.\\n\\nOn another issue, while you should ground the green wire/lug on GCFI outlets\\nwhen ever there is a place to ground them, it is legal in the NEC to use them\\nwithout a ground if no ground is available.  It is better to have the\\nprotection of the Ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don\\'t\\ninstall it.  The interrupter doesn\\'t depend on the ground to trip.  It is\\ndesirable to connect the ground if available, because if the ground is\\nconnected, the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in,\\nwhereas without the ground, it will not trip until someone or something\\nprovides a ground path.  For those questioning the legal use of ungrounded\\nGCFI\\'s, read in the NEC, 210-7 (d) exception. (This is the 1990 code, my \\'93\\ncode is in the city, but I know the rule hasn\\'t changed.  It might be\\nrenumbered though.) \\n\\nWe have only touched the surface concerning grounding ;-} , there is much more\\nto this subject, but most of you have fallen asleep by now.  \\n\\nJohn\\n-- \\n*******************************************************************************\\nJohn H.

Anybody know?\\n\\nI don\\'t know, but I\\'m as willing to speculate as anyone.\\n\\nSeveral people have suggested that the chips use public-key cryptography.\\nAnother possibility is to use Diffie-Hellman key exchange, or some other\\nalgorithm which has a similar effect.  DH allows both ends to agree on\\na session key which they use with symmetric cryptography (something\\nlike DES) for the encryption.\\n\\nHow could the \"back door\" keys work in this system?  I can see a few\\npossibilities.  One is that the DH-like algorithm has the property that\\nthe session key can be deduced by an eavesdropper who knows the back door\\nkeys for one (or possibly both) communicants.  Perhaps the random numbers\\nused in the DH are seeded by the back door key, or some such.\\n\\nAnother possibility, as was suggested here earlier, is that the chips\\nsimply broadcast the session key, encrypted with the chip\\'s own\\ninternal secret key.  In this system the back door keys are secret keys\\nusable for decrypting this session key broadcast.  Actually the chip\\'s\\nsecret key doesn\\'t need to be a public key in this usage, but can be\\nidentical to the secret back-door key.  (This proposal seems most\\nstraightforward to me.)\\n\\nStill another possibility is that the encryption algorithm used for the\\nmessage itself has a \"dual key\" property, that possession of either of\\ntwo keys can be used to decrypt it.  One key would be the session key from\\nthe DH exchange, and the other would be the back door key for the chip.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that one of the proposals Dorothy Denning raised\\nduring her amazingly prescient on-line discussion last November and\\nDecember was a variation on Diffie-Hellman in which a third party would\\nparticipate in deriving the session keys.  This doesn\\'t quite fit into\\nwhat we know of how Clipper works but it hints that those who had early\\nknowledge of Clipper (or whose thinking was somehow synchronized with\\nClipper designers) may have had Diffie-Hellman on their minds.\\n\\nHal Finney\\n',\n",

Firstly, motorcycles do not steer\\nthemselves - only the rider can do that. Secondly, it is the adhesion of the\\ntyre on the road, the suspension geometry  and the ground clearance of the\\n motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve to avoid obstacles, and\\nnot the knowledge of physics between the rider\\'s ears.

The REALLY tricky question is, say I do both (naughty\\nboy that I am) can the government use the information gained in the civil\\ntrial (ie. my key) to gain access to my files for use in the criminal\\nprosecution.

Smith)\\nSubject: Voltage Multiplier Problem.\\nOrganization: Computer Science, Liverpool University\\nLines: 53\\nNntp-Posting-Host: goyt.csc.liv.ac.uk\\n\\nHi,\\n\\n   I\\'ve just built a valve preamp and use a diode/capacitor\\nvoltage multiplier to step the 12vAC supply voltage up to approx \\n260vDV. As the load resistance increases, the RC constant decreases\\nand hence the output voltage drops. I need as high an output\\nvoltage as possible. (about 260v).\\n  The circuit consists of seven voltage multiplier stages\\n(ie 14 diodes and 14 capacitors) each capacitor develops about 38v\\nacross them, and I take the output from across seven capacitors=260v.\\n  Each capacitor is 100mfd at 68v.\\n If I increase each of the capacitors rating (220-470mfd), that will\\nincrease the RC constant, and hence alleviate some of the problem.\\nThese capacitors are going to be a little expensive as I need 14 of\\nthem, So:\\n\\n1. What would happen if I connected a 470mfd at 400v capacitor in parallel \\nwith the output (and hence in parallel with the seven 100mfd capacitors)?\\n  Will it, as I assume, increase the C in circuit and hence increase\\nthe RC time constant? If it does, and my output voltage becomes more\\nstable by doing this, then I will have killed two birds with one stone...\\nas I am experiencing some 50Hz ripple (and hence amp hum), and this new\\ncapacitor will \\'smooth\\' this out.\\n\\nand\\n2. Can anyone recomend a suitable value for an inductor (choke) to\\nbe placed in the output line of the power supply to filter out\\nthe 50Hz mains hum. Lowest resistance possible !\\n\\n  I\\'ve not got my preamp with me at the moment because it is TOO MUCH\\nof a distraction....

My top is a 46L and the bottom is a 48L.

The jacket fits me ok in the chest, slightly snug at the\\nwaist, and too small in the arms.  I can't imagine finding a one-piece\\nsize that would have fit correctly, as even the 2 piece has it's\\nproblems (strange, since my V-Pilot jacket fits great all over, and\\nwhen I tried the matching pants, they fit like a glove as well).\\n\\nI can only assume the models Aero Design uses to design its suits are\\nin some way different from us real folks.\\n\\nAlso, even though it's related to convienience, you look pretty damn\\nwierd walking around with the tops and bottoms while running errands.\\nI've gotten some really suspicious looks, and sweated a lot while in a\\nstore wearing the whole suit, since you can't fit the top and bottom\\nin any motorcycle storage device yet devised (except the trunk in my\\nsidecar rig :-).  With the two piece, I unzip the pants (I generally\\nleave the two pieces zipped together, primarily because the pants fall\\ndown unless I pull the cheesy elastic belt-type band real tight),\\nstuff them in one of my spacious BMW saddlebags (the pants just fit),\\nand run errands just wearing the jacket.  Actually, if I know I'll be\\nrunning errands, I just wear my V-Pilot jacket, but that's just me...\\n\\nAs far as crash protection, I'd say that both suits are probably\\nequal.  It seems that for weather protection, if anything the 2 piece\\nprovides a little more because of the jacket overlapping the pants by\\n3 inches.  The 2 piece is probably a little less comfortable around\\nthe waist, just because of the extra layer of stuff, but maybe not.\\n\\nSo I'd have to vote for the two piece.

It should be the only non-smt chip on\\nthe board.  Slightly below center, and left.    The bios should read \\neither :     62-000042-015 or\\n             62-000094-0x2\\n\\n     If the last 3 digits are 013, you got problems.\\n\\n>\\n>Controller jumpers are set as follows: (\"-\" represents jumper)\\n>\\tW1\\t1-2 3\\n>       W2      1-2 3\\n>\\tW3\\t1-2\\n>\\tW4\\t1 2-3\\n>\\tW5\\t1 2 3\\n>\\tW6\\t1-2 3\\n>\\tW7\\t1 2 3\\n\\n    Looks right.

Those are\\nwhat control what drive the controller thinks it has.   If you have\\nthe 62-000042-015 rom, set it like this:\\n\\n              5 + +    open\\n              6 + +    open             \\n              7 + +    open        \\n              8 + +    open\\n              4 + +    closed\\n              3 + +    closed\\n              2 + +    open\\n              1 + +    open\\n\\n    Note:   those are how WD runs the numbers on the jumper block.\\nTop to bottom.   +\\'s represent the jumper pins.    Pins 3,4, and 8\\nselect the first drive setting (drive 0) and pins 1,2 and 7 select the\\nsecond drive (drive 1).   \\n\\n      If you have the 62-000094 rom, it\\'s a auto-config, and I\\'ll have\\nto look up how to do it... I don\\'t have the big book right here.\\n\\n>2.)\\tAre the jumpers on the card/drive set correctly?\\n\\n      See above.  You might have problems if the S1 jumpers are not\\nright.   Also,  at the risk of being insulting, make sure the cables\\nare on right and good. 8).    On the jumper on the 251, try moving it\\nto the opposite side of the drive.    It\\'s one or the other.   \\n     The narrow data cable goes to J2.   I\\'ve thrown it on J3 a few\\ntimes and banged my head for a day.....\\n\\n>3.)\\tIs my system\\'s BIOS in need of an upgrade?\\n\\n     Dunno.    IBM roms had to be later than 10/27/82.   A quick way\\nto check is to boot dos and run debug.   Enter:\\n       \\n        -d f000:fff5 fffc    (the - is the debug prompt)\\n   \\n    This will return the rom date, if it\\'s of any use.\\n\\n>Keith Rice\\n\\n      If I oversimplified any of the above, I appologize.

Since we apparently\\ndon\\'t have the sensor base you folks have, they\\'re installing\\ncameras at strategic points along the freeways (initial tests\\nare going to be in the Santa Clara area I\\'m told), with the\\nvideo being piped into a command center they\\'re building\\nsomewhere in the East Bay.  I\\'m not sure if frame grabbers or\\ncheap labor will be used to interpret the data, but large\\nmulti-colored status displays will show the various routes\\nusing different colors to represent the various average speeds\\nfor each stretch of highway.  An announcer will sit in front\\nof the status \\'wall\\', and will relay continuous verbal traffic\\nstatus to those who want to receive it.  They\\'re apparently also\\nlooking into licensing a low-AM frequency to be dedicated to\\nproviding continuous audio from this system.\\n\\nIn the mean time, they\\'ll set up large incandescent display\\nboards along the test stretch to provide commuters with data\\non traffic conditions up ahead.  My understanding is that the\\nsystem is subsidized as a pilot program, and information from it\\nwill be available free of charge.  Perhaps the LA system is\\nsimilarly free or provided at an obviously subsidized rate (read\\n\"cheap\").\\n\\nWe also have the traffic reports that are broadcast on the SAP\\naudio channel of television channels 2 and 36.  These are verbal\\nreports, qualified with a identification tone to tell in-vehicle\\nreceivers like the \\'Auto Talk\\' that the information coming next is\\napplicable to a given area.  In LA, they\\'re probably using some\\nother TV channels, but the concept is the same.  Try setting your\\nstereo TV or VCR to receive the SAP audio channel, and go station\\njumping to find out which one is broadcasting this information.\\nI believe this program is also subsidized, making the in-vehicle\\nreceivers cheap to purchase (and without having to incur monthly\\nfees to use it).  Since the makers of these in-vehicle receivers\\ndon\\'t have to pay for the broadcast (this may not be completely\\ntrue), they likely have no investment in keeping the system\\nup and running when the Cal Trans stuff hits the airwaves.  You\\nmay have a nifty little TV audio receiver in your car, nothing\\nmore, when this happens.  Perhaps a word to the wise...?  ;)\\n\\nI think we\\'d all be interested in a summary post if you get more\\ninfo on how the LA system is networked and paid for.\\n\\nCheers,\\nAlan\\n<acooney@netcom.com>\\n\\n',\n",

However, expressing\\n    complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well\\n    defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far\\n    exceed their technical skills.\\n\\n    The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression\\n    tools has compounded this problem.  In hypermedia, multimedia and\\n    virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the\\n    observer or participant.  Wading through a multitude of\\n    simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar\\n    representions, a confounded user asks: \"What does it all mean?\"\\n\\n    Since image construction, transmission, reception, decipherment and\\n    ultimate understanding are complex tasks, strongly influenced by\\n    physiology, education and culture; and, since electronic media\\n    radically amplify each processing step, then we, as electronic\\n    communicators, must determine the fundamental paradigms for\\n    composing imagery for understanding.\\n\\n    Therefore, the purpose of this conference is to bring together a\\n    breadth of disciplines, including, but not limited to, the\\n    physical, biological and computational sciences, technology, art,\\n    psychology, philosophy, and education, in order to define and\\n    discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the\\n    computer graphics context.\\n\\n\\n    FEATURED SPEAKERS INCLUDE:\\n\\n        Psychology/Perception:\\n            Marc De May, University of Ghent\\n            Beverly J.

What modulation scheme do these Clipper boxes use?\\nIs it possible to record the tones for use after the keys are obtained?\\nI thought it was quite difficult to record a modem session at some\\nintermediate point on the line. Maybe they have taken a crash course\\nin data comms and have a unit that demodulates the tones and stores the\\ndigital stream for decryption later. This would still suffer from the\\nsame problems as trying to record the tones as the demodulator would not\\nbe at one end of the line.

These things are proposed\\nfor use by US corporations to secure their foreign offices, where phone\\nline quality may well be poor.

Your HD stopped boot probably because your HD controller can't handle the faster BUS speed.  I have a 486-33DX, I set my bus divider to CLK/2.5, that is close to 13MHz.  I can gain singificant performace increase on my Video card and harddisk transfer rate when I boost the bus speed.  And my system work flawlessly under this setting.

I bought it in California, and if\\nit\\'ll let me, I\\'d like to keep it for another year.  The only problem is these\\nIndiana winters--my heater controls don\\'t work.\\n\\nThe car has vacuum operated control switches for the vents.  Right now it is\\nstuck in the \"vent\" mode.  It will blow warm air, but I can\\'t switch the air\\nflow to either the floor (I can live without this) or the defrost (I can\\'t \\nlive without this).  I probably could just jam the air deflector to the \\ndefrost position, but this blows a lot of air in my face and is, well,\\nkind of like putting a vacuum cleaner in reverse.\\n\\nI have taken parts of the dash off and looked at the vacuum system and I think\\nthe problem (or part of it) is with the two diaphragms which control up/down\\nand outside/inside air flow.  THe diaphragm which controls outside(vent)/in-\\nside(no vent) air is cracked most of the way around, and the other one is\\nprobably damaged too, considering the advanced age of the car.\\n\\nTwo questions:\\n\\n\\t1)  Is there anything I should be aware of about this (other than\\n\\tthe fact that I should move from Indiana) ?\\n\\n\\t2)  In the event that replacement diaphragms aren\\'t available, is there\\n\\ta way to \"fix\" this?\\n\\nTHanks for any advice/info\\n\\nselah,\\n\\nDan\\nlovall@physics.purdue.edu\\n',\n",

One\\nguy was thinking about it and almost everybody shot him to hell.  Well,\\nI saw one think that someone said about \"Show me a team that used Split-\\nfires....\"  Well, here\\'s some additional insight and some theories\\nabout splitfire plugs and how they boost us as oppossed to cages.\\n\\nSplitfires were originally made to burn fuel more efficiently and\\nincreased power for the 4x4 cages.  Well, for these guys, splitfires\\nincreased performance by increasing TORQUE.  They weren\\'t focusing\\non horsepower numbers.\\n\\nNow how does this related to us high performance pilots?  Well, that\\ndepends.  Do you pilot a high performance 2- or 4-cylinder machine?\\nIn the case of 4-cylinders, splitfires would increase overall torque,\\nbut 4\\'s make more top end horsepower with its torque packed down low.\\nSo for 4\\'s, splitfires would not significantly increase power.\\n\\nBut what about twins?...  Many of you 4 guys laugh at some of us twins,\\nbut many times we carry less weight which sometimes can make up for\\nthe hp loss (see Doug Polen vs. Scott Russell, Daytona 1992).  However,\\ntwins make more torque thoughout their powerbands.   So how does this\\ntranslate?  Increased torque should \"theoretically\" help twins make\\nmore power.  Splitfire claims that there should be not extra mods\\nor anything made, just stick \\'em in.\\n\\nNow I don\\'t know about all of this (and I\\'m trying to catch up with\\nsomebody about it now), but Splitfires should help twins more than\\n4\\'s.        \\n\\nAs far as racing teams....

RIPEM allows your electronic mail to have the\\n four security facilities provided by PEM: disclosure protection\\n (optional), originator authenticity, message integrity measures, and\\n non-repudiation of origin (always).  (See: \"What is PEM?\")\\n\\n RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>.\\n Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines,\\n which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.\\n\\n The current version of RIPEM is 1.0.5; the current version of the\\n Macintosh port of RIPEM is 0.7.\\n\\n2)  How can I get RIPEM?\\n\\n RIPEM uses the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is\\n considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution\\n to persons who are not citizens or permanent residents in the U.S or\\n Canada without an export license.  No such license has been obtained\\n (nor would one likely be granted unless the RSA key exchange were\\n shortened to 512 bits and the symmetric cipher changed to something\\n weaker than DES.  There are some suggestions that this situation may\\n change now that Clinton is in office.)  The author requests in the\\n README file that this law not be violated:\\n\\n #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution\\n #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me,\\n #the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM.\\n\\n Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is\\n included with the distribution.  You should read it before using\\n RIPEM.\\n\\n RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent\\n residents in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README\\n file for info.  Note that the non-RSAREF portion of RIPEM is not a\\n product of RSA Data Security, Incorporated; they merely are helping\\n distribute it.\\n\\n RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its \"home site\" on\\n ripem.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the\\n U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out\\n how to obtain access, FTP there, cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file\\n GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are\\n available here in addition to the full source tree.\\n\\n3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine?\\n\\n Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of\\n Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to\\n Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice\\n Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports\\n are expected, and help of users is invited.\\n\\n4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer?\\n\\n Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend\\n on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users\\n guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM\\n with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH.\\n Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU\\n Emacs.\\n\\n If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one\\n in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure,\\n and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.\\n\\n5)  What is RSA?\\n\\n RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This means\\n that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to\\n decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other,\\n you may publish your encryption, or public, key widely and keep your\\n decryption, or private, key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public\\n key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to\\n decrypt it.  Note that the \"message\" sent with RSA is normally just\\n the DES key to the real plaintext. (See \"What is DES?\")\\n\\n Note that the above only provides for disclosure protection.  For\\n originator authenticity, message integrity, and non-repudiation of\\n origin services to be implemented, the fingerprint of the message\\n (See \"What is a fingerprint, like MD5?\") is encrypted with the\\n sender\\'s private key.  The recipient, or a dispute-resolving\\n authority, can use the sender\\'s public key to decrypt it and confirm\\n that the message must have come from the sender and was not altered.\\n\\n RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who\\n invented it.  To find out lots more about RSA and modern cryptography\\n in general, ftp to rsa.com and look in pub/faq/.  Some information\\n also may be in sci.crypt.\\n\\n6)  What is DES?\\n\\n DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or\\n secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to\\n encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA.\\n\\n RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts\\n your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the\\n recipient\\'s public RSA key and includes the result in the letter,\\n allowing the recipient to recover the DES key.\\n\\n DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a\\n key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it\\n should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large\\n corporation or government agency.  It is not likely that the PEM\\n standard will incorporate support for other symmetric ciphers in the\\n near future, because there is a strong feeling that PEM should be\\n stable so it can become utilized widely without early problems with\\n interoperability.\\n\\n7)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5?\\n\\n MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc.\\n It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash,\\n of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not\\n possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a\\n different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus,\\n instead of signing the entire message with the sender\\'s private key,\\n only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication.\\n\\n MD5s can also be exchanged directly for authentication; for example,\\n RIPEM public keys include an MD5 of the public key in the file, so\\n parties wishing to confirm their keys are authentic via a separate\\n channel merely need exchange MD5s of keys and verify their accuracy.\\n\\n MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often\\n used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a\\n passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.\\n\\n MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in\\n RFC 1321.\\n\\n There have been some recent suggestions that MD5 may not be as strong\\n a hash as was originally believed; presumably some other hash\\n function will be used if this is accepted as true.\\n\\n8)  What is PEM?\\n\\n PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a standard for allowing transfer of\\n encrypted electronic mail generated over a long period of time by a\\n working group of experts.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these\\n documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115.\\n\\n RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM\\n specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not\\n handle at this time.  Their addition is planned.\\n\\n9)  What\\'s this about distributing and authenticating keys?\\n\\n For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know\\n your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message\\n received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important\\n that this information be accurate; if a \"bad guy\" convinces her that\\n his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.\\n\\n RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server,\\n the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are\\n described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution.\\n None of them provide perfect security.  The PEM standard calls for\\n key management by certificates; the addition of this feature to RIPEM\\n is planned, but chicken-egg issues still exist.\\n\\n10)  Isn\\'t it a bad idea to use patented algorithms in standards like PEM?\\n\\n This issue has been considered in the standards process.  RFC 1310,\\n the specification for Internet standards, has a discussion (section\\n 6) on what specifications for nondiscriminatory availability must be\\n met for a patented method to be included in a standard.  RFC 1421\\n addresses this issue with regard to the patents covering public-key\\n cryptography.\\n\\n This does not, of course, mean that all questions are settled or that\\n everyone is in agreement.  An interesting exchange on the use of\\n patented algorithms in standards with regard to public-key\\n cryptography is in the League for Programming Freedom archive\\n (available via FTP: ftp.uu.net:/doc/lpf) in the files bidzos.letter\\n and bidzos.response.  (Amusingly, the LPF files on ftp.uu.net are\\n compressed with a patented algorithm.)\\n\\n11)  What about RSADSI/PKP?\\n\\n RSA Data Security, Inc. (RSADSI) is a California-based company\\n specializing in cryptographic technologies.  Public Key Partners is a\\n firm which holds exclusive sub-licensing rights of the following U.S.\\n patents and all of their corresponding foreign patents:\\n\\n      Cryptographic Apparatus and Method\\n      (\"Diffie-Hellman\")............................... No. 4,200,770\\n\\n      Public Key Cryptographic Apparatus\\n      and Method (\"Hellman-Merkle\").................... No. 4,218,582\\n\\n      Cryptographic Communications System and\\n      Method (\"RSA\")................................... No. 4,405,829\\n\\n      Exponential Cryptographic Apparatus\\n      and Method (\"Hellman-Pohlig\").................... No. 4,424,414\\n\\n PKP claims these four patents cover all known methods of public key\\n cryptography.  The two businesses are rather closely related (for\\n example, the same person, Jim Bidzos, is president of both of them.)\\n PKP has licensed this technology to a considerable number of\\n companies (IBM, DEC, Motorola, AT&T, Lotus...) for use in their\\n products.  PKP has also threatened and filed lawsuits defending their\\n patents.\\n\\n RIPEM was originally created with no connection to RSADSI other than\\n its use of the RSAREF library, and for no reason other than its\\n author\\'s desire to see widespread use of public-key cryptography.\\n However, after the ball started rolling, people at RSADSI got\\n interested.  RSADSI decided to carry RIPEM on its FTP site, and some\\n people there started making their own RIPEM keys and contributing\\n code.  RIPEM even won the \"Best Application Built on RSAREF in 1992\"\\n award.\\n\\n12)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar?\\n\\n RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS (Public-Key Cryptography\\n Standards) identifier describing various characteristics about the\\n key, so the first bunch of characters in your key may be the same as\\n those of lots of other people\\'s keys.  This does not mean your keys\\n are similar, but only that they are the same class of key, were\\n generated with the same program, are of the same length, etc.\\n\\n13)  What is PGP?\\n\\n PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy.\\n PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently.\\n PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA.\\n\\n A few major differences between PGP and RIPEM:\\n\\n - PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without\\n   a direct network connection.\\n\\n - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability\\n   of working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be\\n   compatible with anything other than itself.\\n\\n - RIPEM uses RSAREF, a library of RSA routines from RSADSI which\\n   comes with a license allowing noncommercial use.  PGP uses its own\\n   implementation of RSA.  PKP claims that it is a violation of its\\n   patents to \"make, use or sell\" PGP in the U.S. or Canada without\\n   either a license or written permission.  (See: \"DISCLAIMER\")\\n   (See: \"What about RSADSI/PKP?\")  Phil Zimmermann, the author of\\n   PGP, stopped distributing it after being threatened with legal\\n   action; he believed that a licensing scheme could be arranged, but\\n   it hasn\\'t happened and there seems little prospect of it happening\\n   in the future.  He acknowledges in the PGP User\\'s Guide:\\n\\n   #In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency, \\n   #you shouldn\\'t actually run PGP on your computer, because Public\\n   #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is\\n   #contraband.\\n\\n - Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside\\n   the U.S. and Canada without an export license.  However, PGP\\n   already exists on many ftp sites in Europe and other places.\\n\\n Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever, the documentation to PGP is\\n recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues.\\n Unfortunately, it\\'s not distributed separately from the program,\\n which can be difficult to find in the U.S. on FTP sites due to\\n liability concerns.\\n\\n14)  What about RPEM?\\n\\n RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to RIPEM,\\n but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin (which is not RSA) in\\n an attempt to avoid the patents on public-key systems.  It was\\n written by Mark Riordan, who later wrote RIPEM.\\n\\n Its distribution was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many\\n (including Rabin), PKP claimed that their patents were broad enough\\n to cover the cipher employed.  This claim is not universally\\n accepted, but was not challenged for pragmatic reasons.\\n\\n RPEM is not really used anymore.  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP.\\n\\n15)  What is MIME?\\n\\n MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and is\\n described in RFC 1341.  You can find out about it in the newsgroup\\n comp.mail.mime; a FAQ exists on it.  How PEM should interact with\\n MIME is not yet entirely clear; some people use the stopgap solution\\n of having a MIME type application/x-ripem in order to send RIPEM\\n messages as MIME ones.  I hope some standards will emerge.  Draft\\n Internet documents exist on the matter.\\n\\n16)  What is TIS/PEM?\\n\\n Trusted Information Systems is working on a version of Privacy\\n Enhanced Mail for general availability.  Last I heard, it was\\n rumored to be integrated into an existing mail user agent (MH)\\n rather than a stand-alone system, and in beta test.  I don\\'t know\\n much more than that.\\n\\n17)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM...\\n\\n You may wish to check the companion post \"ripem-attacks\" which\\n discusses some of the more obvious attacks on RIPEM\\'s security and\\n what procedures will minimize the risk.  RIPEM\\'s main \"weak area\" is\\n probably key distribution.\\n',\n",

First \\nsome background on my system.  I have a Mitsubishi 63 meg Hard Drive, \\nand am running Smartdrv (the version that comes with Windows 3.1) on \\nit.  I rarely use Windows.  I use a program called Disk Technician \\nGold v1.14 to do diagnostics live time on my hard drive.  It works by \\nhaving a device driver detect whenever more than one read is \\nnecessary for a file, or if there is anything else is wrong with it, \\nand minor problems are fully checked out upon rebooting.  My hard \\ndrive is notorious for bad sectors.  I usually end up with 8 new bad \\nsectors a week.\\n \\n        Here's what happened:  I ran a program, and DTG broke in with \\nan Emergency Warning and recommended I reboot.  It gave me this \\nmessage twice before the program was fully loaded.  I exited the program \\nand did just this.  DTG went through its bootup process, examining \\nfor new errors etc., and a screen popped up and said something about \\nsectors for a brief period of time.\\n \\n        I then went back to the program, executed it again, and the \\nexact same error was detected.  I rebooted and tried again, and the \\nsame error happened again.  So, I removed DTG from memory, and went \\nto the program to see if I could detect anything wrong.  Sure enough \\nthere was a number of read attempts.  So I rebooted and reloaded DTG, \\nbut removed the cache.  I executed the program.  No read errors, \\neither audible or detected by DTG.  I quit the program, loaded the \\ncache, and ran the program again.  The errors were detected.\\n \\n        Ok, so the errors are there, and DTG detects but doesn't fix \\nthem, when the cache is loaded.  When the cache is not loaded there are \\nno errors.  So, to see if the cache was interfering with any other \\nfiles, I went into xtree gold and tagged all files, and searched them \\nfor a random string (in other words, I wanted the program to \\ncompletely read every file on my hard drive).  Before I got through \\nthe c's DTG had detected at least six errors and recommended I reboot.\\n \\n        Does anybody, have any idea why Smartdrv is causing misreads on \\nmy hard drive?  Oh, there are exactly two misreads per file, and 1 in \\nabout every 100 files are affected.  \\n \\n        I originally posted this message to Disk Technician Corp.'s \\nsystem, but I figured someone out in netland may know enough about \\nsmartdrv to help me out.\\n\\n--                    \\nINTERNET:  jdriver@netlink.cts.com (John Driver)\\nUUCP:   ...!ryptyde!netlink!jdriver\\nNetLink Online Communications * Public Access in San Diego, CA (619) 453-1115\\n\",\n",

I would prefer a method that would do this in as little\\n>  time as possible.  I need this for use in a forward raytracing\\n>  program.\\n\\nI think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and\\npolygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of\\npoints.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.\\n\\nFirst, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the\\nJordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into\\nexactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies\\ncompletely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon,\\nor possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.\\n\\nNow, the phrasing of this question says \"if a line intersects a polygon\", so\\nthis is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is\\nto reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to\\nsolve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.\\n\\nIn recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a\\nnew language called PostScript.  (See \"PostScript Language\", by Adobe Systems\\nIncorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).\\n\\nSo, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that\\ndraws the line L and the polygon P, and then \"outputs\" the answer.  By\\n\"output\", we mean the program executes a command called \"showpage\", which\\nactually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick\\nexamination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus\\nthe original problem.\\n\\nThere are two small problems with this approach. \\n\\n\\t(1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the\\n\\treduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice (or equivalently, Zorn\\'s Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.\\n\\n\\t(2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the\\n\\tPostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in\\n\\tother words, will it halt?\\n\\n\\tNow, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a\\n\\tTuring Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is\\n\\tundecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn\\n\\tout to be undecidable.\\n\\n\\nI won\\'t even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite\\nprecision and running out of ink, paper or both.\\n\\nA couple of references might be:\\n\\n1.

Rather than use technology to accommodate\\nthe sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and\\nlaw enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against\\nindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.\\n\\nSophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to\\nprotect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to\\nprotect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption\\ntechnology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\\nunauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\\nby terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\\n\\nA state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"Clipper Chip\" has\\nbeen developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a\\nnew approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,\\nrelatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\\nan ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications\\nusing an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in\\ncommercial use today.\\n\\nThis new technology will help companies protect proprietary\\ninformation, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations\\nand prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted\\nelectronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the\\nability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to\\nintercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. \\n\\nA \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the\\n\"Clipper Chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding\\nAmericans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique\\n\\n\\n                                2\\n\\n\\n\"keys,\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government\\nagencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the\\ndevice is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately\\nin two \"key-escrow\" data bases that will be established by the\\nAttorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to\\ngovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct a\\nwiretap.\\n\\nThe \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with no\\nnew authorities to access the content of the private\\nconversations of Americans.\\n\\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the\\nAttorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new\\ndevices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the\\ngovernment will be offered access to the confidential details of\\nthe algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report\\ntheir findings.\\n\\nThe chip is an important step in addressing the problem of\\nencryption\\'s dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the\\nprivacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield\\ncriminals and terrorists.  We need the \"Clipper Chip\" and other\\napproaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access\\nto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it\\nto hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology\\ntrends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),\\nthe President has directed government agencies to develop a\\ncomprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:\\n\\n     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to\\n          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;\\n\\n     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone\\n          calls and data, under proper court or other legal\\n          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;\\n\\n     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern\\n          technology to build the National Information\\n          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and\\n          the competitiveness of American industry in the global\\n          marketplace; and \\n\\n     --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export\\n          high technology products.\\n\\nThe President has directed early and frequent consultations with\\naffected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the\\nprivacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                3\\n\\nThe Administration is committed to working with the private\\nsector to spur the development of a National Information\\nInfrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer\\ntechnologies to give Americans unprecedented access to\\ninformation.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks\\n(\"information superhighways\") will transmit video, images, HDTV\\nprogramming, and huge data files as easily as today\\'s telephone\\nsystem transmits voice.\\n\\nSince encryption technology will play an increasingly important\\nrole in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act\\nquickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding\\nits use.  The Administration is committed to policies that\\nprotect all Americans\\' right to privacy while also protecting\\nthem from those who break the law.\\n\\nFurther information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. \\nThe provisions of the President\\'s directive to acquire the new\\nencryption technology are also available.  \\n\\nFor additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of\\nStandards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.\\n\\n- - ---------------------------------\\n\\n\\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION\\'S\\nTELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQ:   Does this approach expand the authority of government\\n     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?\\n\\nA:   No.  \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with\\n     no new authorities to access the content of the private\\n     conversations of Americans.\\n\\nQ:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\\n     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\\n     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\\n     decipher the message?\\n\\nA:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\\n     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They\\n     would then present documentation of this authorization to\\n     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and\\n     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug\\n     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are\\n     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key\\n     escrow system.\\n\\nQ:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?\\n\\nA:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent\\n     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the\\n     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will\\n     oversee the key-escrow data banks.\\n\\nQ:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure\\n     how strong the security is?  \\n\\nA:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption\\n     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will\\n     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow\\n     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of\\n     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all\\n     potential users that there are no unrecognized\\n     vulnerabilities.\\n\\nQ:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?\\n\\nA:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the\\n     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in\\n     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the\\n     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet\\n     officials.\\n\\nQ:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?\\n\\nA:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on\\n     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify\\n     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have\\n     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the\\n     decisions related to this initiative.\\n\\nQ:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?\\n\\nA:   The government designed and developed the key access\\n     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the\\n     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product\\n     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip\\n     manufacturer that produces them.\\n\\nQ:   Who provides the \"Clipper Chip\"?\\n\\nA:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,\\n     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device\\n     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed\\n     to other vendors in the future.\\n\\nQ:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? \\n\\nA:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating\\n     the \"Clipper Chip\" into their devices.\\n     \\nQ:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological\\n     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be\\n     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more\\n     powerful encryption devices?\\n\\nA:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be\\n     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow\\n     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product\\n     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive\\n     than others readily available today, but it is just one\\n     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to\\n     encryption technology, which the Administration is\\n     developing.\\n\\n     The Administration is not saying, \"since encryption\\n     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,\\n     we will prohibit it outright\" (as some countries have\\n     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \"every\\n     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an\\n     unbreakable commercial encryption product.\"  There is a\\n     false \"tension\" created in the assessment that this issue is\\n     an \"either-or\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,\\n     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,\\n     balanced approach such as is proposed with the \"Clipper\\n     Chip\" and similar encryption techniques.\\n\\nQ:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton\\n     Administration\\'s policy toward encryption will differ from\\n     that of the Bush Administration?  \\n\\nA:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption\\n     technology in telecommunications and computing and are\\n     committed to working with industry and public-interest\\n     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans\\'\\n     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law\\n     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime\\n     and terrorism.\\n\\nQ:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use\\n     the government hardware?\\n\\nA:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control\\n     requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is\\n     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The\\n     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the\\n     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give\\n     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this\\n     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a\\n     case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these\\n     devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan\\n     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability\\n     of these products.\\n',\n",

I argued this thoroughly about 3-4 weeks ago.  Men and women are\\ndifferent ... physically, physiologically, and psychologically.  Much\\nrecent evidence for this statement is present in the book \"Brainsex\" by\\nAnne Moir and David Jessel.  I recommend you find a copy and read it.\\nTheir book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topic\\nand is well referenced. \\n\\nNow, if women and men are different in some ways, the law can only\\nadequately take into account their needs in these areas where they are\\ndifferent by also taking into account the ways in which men and women\\nare different.  Maternity leave is an example of this -- it takes into\\naccount that women get pregnant.  It does not give women the same rules\\nit would give to men, because to treat women like it treats men in this\\ninstance would be unjust.  This is just simply an obvious example of\\nwhere men and women are intrinsically different!!!!!\\n\\nNow, people make the _naive_ argument that sexism = oppression.\\nHowever, maternity leave is sexist because MEN DO NOT GET PREGNANT. \\nMen do not have the same access to leave that women do (not to the same\\nextent or degree), and therefore IT IS SEXIST.  No matter however much a\\nman _wants_ to get pregnant and have maternity leave, HE NEVER CAN.  And\\ntherefore the law IS SEXIST.  No man can have access to maternity leave,\\nNO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIES TO GET PREGNANT.  I hope this is clear.\\n\\nMaternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just, because the\\nsexism here just reflects the \"sexism\" of nature in making men and women\\ndifferent.  There are many other differences between men and women which\\nare far more subtle than pregnancy, and to find out more of these I\\nrecommend you have a look at the book \"Brainsex\".\\n\\nYour point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious.\\nIf men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologically\\nbecome women!  To have a womb and the other factors required for\\npregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is --\\nso your argument, when it is examined, is seen to be fallacious.  You\\nare saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that \\nwomen can have if they also become women -- which actually just supports\\nmy statement that maternity leave is sexist.\\n\\n>The discrimination comes in when a woman is denied opportunities\\n>because of her (legally determined) sexual inferiorities.

We just bought a 486 DX2/66 Gateway system with a 2 meg ATI\\nUltra Pro video card.  Everything seems to work fine except for the\\nWindows Drivers for 800x600 24 bit, and 800x600 and 1024x768 16 bit\\nmodes.  The fonts and icons start deteriorating after windows startup,\\nand within minutes of use, everything on the screen is totally\\nunintelligible.  Naturally, I called Gateway tech support to inquire\\nabout this.  The technician asked me about the drivers, and I told him it\\nwas version 1.5, build 59.  He told me that the 16 and 24 bit drivers for\\nthe ATI Ultra Pro simply do not work!!!  Is this true?  If so, I\\'m simply\\namazed.  How could this be?  The strange thing is I would have expected\\nto see some discussion on here (unless the subject has made the FAQ!!!).\\n\\nOne very suspicious point that came up later was that he stated that none\\nof the Windows Accelerator boards have working 16 and/or 24 bit drivers\\nfor Windows 3.1.  I easily challenged him on that because I\\'ve been\\nrunning a Diamond 24x in 15 bit mode at home for 4 months now, and I have\\ntested and used the 24 bit mode as well.  He then backed off and said:\\n\"Well, Diamond has been working on those drivers much longer.\"  Anyway, I\\njust wanted to see if anyone else had any trouble and what they did about\\nit.  Any feedback will be appreciated.\\n\\nThe system configuration is:\\n\\nGateway 486 DX2/66 Local Bus\\n16 Megs Ram\\nSCSI HD & CD-ROM\\nUltrastor 34F Local Bus SCSI controller\\nATI Ultra Pro Local Bus with 2MB VRAM\\nDOS 6.0\\nWindows 3.1\\nMach 32 drivers version 1.5 (build 59)\\n\\nThanks in advance.\\n-- \\nAli R.

Hence, you cannot have superhuman\\npowers.  Sound good to you?\\n\\nAnyway, to the evidence question: it depends on the context.  In this group,\\nsince you are posting from a american college site, I\\'m willing to take it\\nas given that you have a pair of blue jeans.  And, assuming there is some\\ncoherency in your position, I will take it as a given that you do not have\\nsuperhuman powers.  Arguments are evidence in themselves, in some respects.\\n\\n>When you say the \"existence of [ sic ] Jesus\", I assume that you \\n>mean just the man, without any special powers, etc.\\n\\nYep.\\n\\n>Many will agree that it is very possible that a man called Jesus DID \\n>in fact live. In fact, I am willing to agree that there was some man named \\n>Jesus. I have no reason to believe that there wasn\\'t ever a man.\\n\\nGood.\\n\\n>However, most of the claims ARE extradinary: eg virgin birth \\n>[ virgin in the sense of not having any sexual intercourse ], resurection, \\n>Son of God, etc. THOSE claims require extra evidence.\\n\\n\"Extra\" evidence?  Why don\\'t we start with evidence at all?\\n\\nI cannot see any evidence for the V. B. which the cynics in this group would\\never accept.

I've got unix loaded on one of my pcs (along with windogs) and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time.  It's pretty ugly.\\n\\nI just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home.  I paid $369 for it.  I\\nhaven't seen IDE drives cheaper.\\n\\n: The original CGA cart back in '84 was $300.  I think the original EGA card\\n: (or PGA?) was $800.  SCSI has stood relatively alone in not coming down\\n: in price, mainly because we're talking about PC's and not Sun's or Sparc\\n: or SGI or (name your favorite unix workstation).  That is, after millions\\n: of PC buying decisions over the years, SCSI has had plenty of time to\\n: come down in price.\\n\\nNo, actually, we're talking about SCSI being expensive simply because\\nnobody did a common interface for the PC.  If they had a common (read:\\neasily implemented) method of adding scsi to a PC (like as in a Sun or\\nMac), then you'd find SCSI the connection medium of choice.\\n\\n: I won't argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good, well implimented\\n: data highway, but I still want to know why it intrinsically better\\n: (than IDE, on an ISA bus) when it comes to multi-tasking OS's when\\n: managing data from a single SCSI hard drive.\\n\\nOn a single drive, SCSI is more expensive.  But, you bought your PC for\\nexpandibility, so, you'd want to add more drives or whatever.  The\\nfollowing are why I find SCSI intrinsically better than IDE:\\n\\nA (partial?) list:\\n\\t1.  You can add many different types of devices and access them \\n\\tconcurrently.\\n\\t2.  A SCSI device works on many different machines (I have a mac\\n\\tand a PC at home and moving hard drives between them is VERY nice\\n\\twith SCSI -- hook them up and away they go)\\n\\t3.  SCSI devices work together better than IDE devices.  For\\n\\tinstance, recently, I added an older connor 100 meg IDE to a maxtor\\n\\t212 meg IDE.  The connor *MUST* be setup as the slave.  It will\\n\\twork no other way.  On SCSI, you set the address, check the\\n\\ttermination, plug it in, and away it goes.\\n\\t4.  I have a problem with IDE's mutual exclusion - I notice that\\n\\tthe time it takes to switch from accessing drive c: to drive d: is\\n\\tquite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c:\\n\\tto d: on a SCSI system.  Under a multitasking OS, this is very\\n\\tnoticable, as many things can be going on at once.\\n\\nOne neat thing that I've noticed lately (a fringe benefit) has been the\\nability to add older (almost dead) drives as storage on a SCSI system with\\nlittle problem -- we've got a bunch of almost dead 20 meg drives that I've\\nadded to my PC.

Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)\\n  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats\\n  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert\\n  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.\\n  Tgif\\'s sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu\\n  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)\\n\\nd. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).\\n  This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all\\n  your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.\\n\\ne. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output\\n  bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.\\n\\nf. \\'ice\\' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It\\'s a PostScript-based\\n  graphical editor,and it\\'s available for anonymous ftp from Internet host\\n  eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12).

This was\\n  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working\\n  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL\\n  or would be willing to buy it.  It\\'s a few thousand dollars (American) I\\n  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general\\n  purpose packages I\\'ve heard of, besides what TerraMar has.\\n  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I\\'m not sure how general purpose\\n  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I\\n  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh\\n  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image\\n  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I\\'ve\\n  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best\\n  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large\\n  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That\\'s a\\n  freebie if you want it\"\\n\\n  \"My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,\\n  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its\\n  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It\\n  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing\\n  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even\\n  Excel on the Mac if it\\'s not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH\\n  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which\\n  that combination couldn\\'t handle, and the speed and ease of use\\n  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it\\'s mostly astronomical\\n  image processing which I\\'ve been doing. This means image enhancement,\\n  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image\\n  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity\\n  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve\\n  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) \"\\n\\n[ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and\\n for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder .

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)\\n===================================================\\n\\nGRASS\\n-----\\n  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army\\n  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and\\n  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a\\n  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,\\n  although it is reported to have significant image processing\\n  capabilities.\\n\\n  Feature Descriptions\\n\\n  I use GRASS  because it\\'s public domain and can be obtained through the\\n  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source\\n  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass\\n  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using\\n  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who\\n  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very\\n  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software.\" A first review  of\\n  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel\\n  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose\\n  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in\\n  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the\\n  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric\\n  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective\\n  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus\\n  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them\\n  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh\\n  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for\\n  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC\\n  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,\\n  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster\\n  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it\\n  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented\\n  in raster (grid-cell) form.\\n\\n  Availability\\n\\n  CERL\\'s Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:\\n  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).\\n\\n  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to\\n  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  This location will be the new \"canonical\" source for GRASS software, as\\n  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.\\n  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and\\n  \"tar\" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John\\n  Parks\\' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,\\n  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review\\n  it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently\\n  maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be\\n  directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu\\n\\n  Support\\n\\n  Listserv mailing lists:\\n\\n  grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level\\n  questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send\\n  subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level\\n  questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation\\n  of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to\\n  grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of\\n  the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in\\n  Champaign, IL). The OGI is providing the lists as a service to the\\n  community; while OGI and CERL employees will participate in the lists,\\n  we can make no claim as to content or veracity of messages that pass\\n  through the list.  If you have questions, problems, or comments, send\\n  E-mail to lists-owner@amber.cecer.army.mil and a human will respond.\\n\\nMicrostation Imager\\n-------------------\\n  Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) sells a wide range of GIS\\n  software/hardware. Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager\\n  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a\\n  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.\\n\\n  Feature Description\\n\\n  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.\\n  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a\\n  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).\\n  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.\\n  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering\\n  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,\\n  generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages\\n  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band\\n  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.\\n\\n  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle\\n  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available\\n  for GIS applications.\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)\\n  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software\\n  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.\\n\\nPCI\\n---\\n  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes\\n  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of\\n  remote sensing data in eight or ten different \"industry standard\"\\n  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I\\n  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix\\n  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly\\n  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.\\n\\n  The \"PCI software\" consists of several classes/groups/packages of\\n  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common \"PCI\\n  database\" disk file.  The \"Tape I/O\" package is a set of utility\\n  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape\\n  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the \"PCI database\" file;\\n  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can\\n  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several\\n  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap\\n  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type\\n  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically\\n  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and\\n  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.\\n  \"multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5\"), and\\n  God only knows what all else -- there\\'s a LOT.  I don\\'t have and don\\'t\\n  use these, so can\\'t say much about them; you only buy the packages your\\n  particular application/interest calls for.\\n\\n  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight \"parameters,\" read from\\n  a common \"parameter file\" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your \"default\\n  directory.\"  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same\\n  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting\\n  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a\\n  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to\\n  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,\\n  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also\\n  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There\\'s\\n  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled\\n  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI\\n  data structures (database file, parameter file).\\n\\n  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but\\n  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the\\n  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle\\n  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a\\n  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the\\n  Macintosh calls \"raw\") data from tape, in a number of different\\n  \"interleave\" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the\\n  graphic-arts industry\\'s \"CT2T\" format, would probably (I haven\\'t tried)\\n  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT\\n  YOU\\'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start\\n  over.  It\\'s worth noting that the PCI \"database\" file is designed to\\n  contain not only \"raster\" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map\\n  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of\\n  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often\\n  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,\\n  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this\\n  can go into the PCI \"database\").\\n\\n  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX\\n  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific\\n  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to\\n  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would\\n  display directly from a PCI \"database\" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus\\n  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be \"overkill\"\\n  in your case; it seems designed for the very \"high end\"\\n  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn\\'t suffice\\n  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It\\'s\\n  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which\\n  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe\\n  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these\\n  areas.\\n\\nSPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)\\n--------------------------------\\n  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis\\n  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed\\n  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels\\n  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since\\n  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging\\n  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.\\n\\n  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and\\n  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).\\n  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement\\n  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.\\n\\n  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may\\n  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame\\n  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you\\'re interested.  PCW requires X\\n  for display.\\n\\nMAP II\\n------\\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.\\n\\nCLRview\\n-------\\n  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit\\n  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.\\n\\n  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the\\n  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.

The gun processes two doppler\\nreturns--the speed of the car relative to the pavement and the speed\\nof the target, taking the difference between the two. Some guns with\\na \"moving mode\" actually have a split beam with one beam aimed\\npreferentially at the pavement.\\n\\nCar and Driver had a good article on traffic radar, but it was back in\\n1985. I used its contents and references to defend myself against a bogus\\nradar-measured ticket. It detailed \"moving mode,\" which is easier to\\ndefend against because of the increased amount of variables.\\n\\n-- \\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n       Dave Medin\\t\\t\\tPhone:\\t(205) 730-3169 (w)\\n    SSD--Networking\\t\\t\\t\\t(205) 837-1174 (h)\\n    Intergraph Corp.\\n       M/S GD3004 \\t\\tInternet: dtmedin@catbyte.b30.ingr.com\\n  Huntsville, AL 35894\\t\\tUUCP:  ...uunet!ingr!b30!catbyte!dtmedin\\n\\n   ******* Everywhere You Look (at least around my office) *******\\n\\n * The opinions expressed here are mine (or those of my machine)\\n',\n",

This is due to the protocal the takes place between the two drives \\nwhen performing diagnostics.\\n   There are four links, LK1, LK2, LK4 and LK5, adjacent to the 40 way \\ninterface connector. They have the following functions and are described \\nin order as viewed from the end of the drive, with the first jumper \\ndescribed nearest the 40 way interface connector.\\n\\nLK2: LED \\n     When fitted, this jumper connects the LED drive to pin 39 of the\\n     interface. This allows a LED to be connected to the interface. An\\n     external current limiting resistor needs to be fitted in series with\\n     the LED when this option is selected. The value of the resistor will\\n     be dependant on the LED type chosen but will be in the range of 130\\n     Ohms ot 220 Ohms.\\n\\nLK1: Dual Drives\\n     This jumper must be fitted when two drives are attached to a single\\n     bus. It fallows communication across the 40 way interface connector,\\n     indicating, to the Master drive, the presence of a Slave.\\n\\nLK4: Master\\n     When fitted this signifies that the drive jumpered is a Master. If\\n     there are two drives connected on a single bus then only one may be\\n     jumpered in this way.\\n\\nLK5: IOChRdy\\n     When fitted this connects the IOChRdy signal to the drive, it is \\n     fitted when the drive is used in host systems that have a higher\\n     data transfer rate than the drive i.e. greater than 4 MBytes per\\n     second when using 1:1 interleave. This jumper is not normally \\n     fitted as most hosts transfer at a lower rate than 4 MBytes per\\n     second.\\n\\n   There are four possible Master/Slave configurations in which a drive(s)\\nmay be jumpered:\\n\\n     Master, single drive with LED on interface\\t\\tLK2 & LK4 fitted.\\n     Master, single drive without LED on interface\\tLK4 only fitted.\\n     Master, dual drive without LED on interface\\tLK4 & LK1 fitted.\\n     Slave, dual drive without LED on interface\\t\\tNo jumpers fitted.\\n     Master, dual drive with LED on interface\\t\\tLK4, LK1 & LK2 fitted.\\n     Slave, dual drive with LED on interface\\t\\tLK2 only fitted.\\n\\n   The Master drive will delay power-up for approximately two seconds to\\nreduce power surges in applications where dual drives are used.\\n\\n   The other connections for a LED will be found close to the 28 way \\nconnector at the other end of the drive. This LED driver is not affected\\nby the link options. An internal current limiting resistor is on the \\ndrive for this LED driver. Refer to the product specification for further\\ndetails.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n***************************   S E A G A T E   *************************\\n\\nThere is a list of most Seagate HD (including MFM, SCSI, ESDIand IDE) on\\nevery Simtel mirror under\\n\\n/msdos/dskutl/1seagate.zip\\n\\nIt contains info about the following drives:\\n\\n\\t    st1144a\\tst138a\\t    st274a\\tst3283a\\nst1057a     st1156a\\tst1400a     st280a\\tst351ax\\nst1090a     st1162a\\tst1401a     st3051a\\tst9051a\\nst1102a     st1186a\\tst1480a     st3096a\\tst9077a\\nst1111a     st1201a\\tst157a\\t    st3120a\\tst9096a\\nst1126a     st1239a\\tst2274a     st3144a\\tst9144a\\nst1133a     st125a\\tst2383a     st325ax\\n\\n\\n*********************\\tT E A C   **************\\n\\nModel: SD-3105\\n\\n                Cyls.

The human\\nmind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a\\nhill.\\nHow then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing\\nthe values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On\\nwhat grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It\\nseems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you\\nhave to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what\\nin nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to\\nestablish your values.\\nSince every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what\\ndifference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or\\notherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only\\nway an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the\\nobjection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn\\'t like it\\n- that\\'s it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer\\nthat it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries\\nno weight in any \"absolute\" sense.\\nThat you don\\'t like what God told people to do says nothing about God\\nor God\\'s commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your\\nnervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled\\nwith a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your\\nobjections -seem- well founded is due to the way you\\'ve been\\nconditioned; there is no \"truth\" content. The whole of your\\nintellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.\\nI didn\\'t make these rules, it\\'s inherent in naturalistic atheism and\\nto be consistent, you have to accept the non-significance of any human\\nthought, even your own.

The opinions expressed are those\\n              of the user and not necessarily those of Oracle.\\nLines: 41\\n\\n\\nAs the subjects says, Windows 3.1 keeps crashing (givinh me GPF) on me of  \\nlate.  It was never a very stable package, but now it seems to crash every  \\nday.  The worst part about it is that it does not crash consistently: ie I  \\ncan't reproduce crashes, and they are not always GPF's in the same  \\napplication. Sometimes I can recover by simply closing the application  \\nthat caused an error, but other times, windows acts very strange, and I  \\nneed to re-boot.\\n\\nSome background:  I have a Leading Edge 486sx25 with Phoenix BIOS.  When I  \\nfirst got it it had 4Mg of memory.  It ran windows fine (not too many  \\nGPF's).  Then, a couple of weekends ago, I installed Lotus 123 for windows  \\n(with ATM), a game card and an additional 4  1Mg SIMMS.  The Leading edge  \\nmachine is kind of strange, in that it has the IDE controler built into  \\nthe motherboard, the CPU is actually on a sparate board that plugs into  \\nthe motherboard and the SIMMS it uses are Macintosh SIMMS! Apparently I  \\nwas told that the Leading Edge had the parity bit built into the mother  \\nboard.  The original 4Mg 80ns SIMMS where of the 2 chip variety from  \\nSAMSUNG, and the ones I installed are 8 chip SIMMS. They are recognized  \\nfine by the BIOS RAM check. The game card is a generic $20 gamecard.\\n\\nThe reason why I mention the hardware like this is that sometimes  \\nrebooting the machine using the reset button or ctl-alt-del still leaves  \\nthe machine kind of flaky, but turning it on and off doesn't. \\n\\nI haven't tried taking out the RAM or the game card, because as I said  \\nthese GPF are not reproducible at will.  I have gone through and entire  \\nday using the computer with no problems and then I might get 5 or so GPF's  \\nin the sppace of 20 minutes?\\n\\nWhat can I do.  This situation is most annoying... Are there any good  \\ndiagnostic tools for hardware? Do you think that this might be a software  \\nproblem (ie EMM386 etc.)? If it helps, i have manage to get GPF's on After  \\nDark, quicken, Paint shop pro. A lot of them have been in user.exe or  \\ngdi.exe.\\n\\nAny help is truly appreciated.....\\n\\n-Eric\\n\\nebosco@us.oracle.com\\n\",\n",

I pulled over at first opportunity to sus out the damage. \\nMy bike is a Kawasaki GPX250R with footpegs that are hinged and sprung such\\nthat they fold upward and backward on contact with ground etc., and on the\\nlower extreme corner of each peg there is mounted a \"bank-follower\", or a\\nlittle stud that theoretically is the first bit to hit the ground in a\\n100%-banked turn.  The stud is mounted on the footpeg by a threaded bit about 7\\nmm long, which screws into a threaded hole in the footpeg.  Now for the\\nmystery.\\n\\nThe stud on the side of the bike that clunked when I turned was absent.  I\\'m\\nfairly sure it was there before the event.  There was no damage to the end of\\nthe footpeg where the stud would ordinarily have been.  In fact, the thread in\\nthe hole in the footpeg was perfectly intact, with no evidence of something\\nhaving been forcefully ripped out of it only moments previously.  \\n\\nOkay all you engineering types, how the f**k do you explain this ?  How can you\\nrip a tightly fitting steel thread out of a threaded hole (in alloy) without\\ndamaging the thread in the hole ?  Is this some sort of hi-tech design thingo\\nthat Kawasaki never mentioned, like that the end of the footpeg suddenly\\nchanges phase on impact, to let the stud rip out, then changes back to a solid\\n?

Our current automation\\nconsoles date from the early 60\\'s and don\\'t provide this function.\\n\\nWe already have the combo failsafe/contact rollers to read the cuetapes,\\nand our dimmer system will raise the houselights when its fade-up control\\ncircuit (120 VAC) is momentarily closed, for at least 0.5 second.\\n\\nI\\'ve tried wiring the dimmer control to a 12V relay, activated when the\\ncue tape completes the circuit.  Low tech and simple, but there\\'s one\\nproblem:  In order to get the 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be\\na sh**load of cuetape on the film.  (35mm runs at 90 feet per minute,\\nso to get a 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be at least 9 inches of solid\\ncuetape!)\\n\\nIdeally, I would like to use a single cross-cue to accomplish this function.\\n(A single strip of cuetape perpendicular to the length of the film)\\nThis would give a pulse of approximately 1/100 of a second.\\nWhat I need is a circuit to detect the short cue and activate the relay\\nfor around 1/2 second.  The ability to adjust how long the relay\\nis activated would be nice.  I figure this would require an RC circuit\\nof some sort.

The parts are\\nmostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.\\nWe don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask.\\nNotes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.\\n\\nThe sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu \\nas /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography \\nFAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers \\nevery 21 days.\\n\\n\\nContents:\\n\\n* What is public-key cryptography?\\n* What's RSA?\\n* Is RSA secure?\\n* How fast can people factor numbers?\\n* What about other public-key cryptosystems?\\n\\n\\n* What is public-key cryptography?\\n\\n  In a classic cryptosystem, we have encryption functions E_K and\\n  decryption functions D_K such that D_K(E_K(P)) = P for any plaintext\\n  P. In a public-key cryptosystem, E_K can be easily computed from some\\n  ``public key'' X which in turn is computed from K. X is published, so\\n  that anyone can encrypt messages. If D_K cannot be easily computed\\n  from X, then only the person who generated K can decrypt messages.\\n  That's the essence of public-key cryptography, published by Diffie\\n  and Hellman in 1976.\\n\\n  In a classic cryptosystem, if you want your friends to be able to\\n  send secret messages to you, you have to make sure nobody other than\\n  them sees the key K. In a public-key cryptosystem, you just publish X,\\n  and you don't have to worry about spies.\\n\\n  This is only the beginning of public-key cryptography. There is an\\n  extensive literature on security models for public-key cryptography,\\n  applications of public-key cryptography, other applications of the\\n  mathematical technology behind public-key cryptography, and so on.\\n\\n* What's RSA?\\n\\n  RSA is a public-key cryptosystem defined by Rivest, Shamir, and\\n  Adleman.  For full details, there is a FAQ available by ftp at\\n  RSA.COM. Here's a small example.\\n\\n  Plaintexts are positive integers up to 2^{512}. Keys are quadruples\\n  (p,q,e,d), with p a 256-bit prime number, q a 258-bit prime number,\\n  and d and e large numbers with (de - 1) divisible by (p-1)(q-1). We\\n  define E_K(P) = P^e mod pq, D_K(C) = C^d mod pq.\\n\\n  Now E_K is easily computed from the pair (pq,e)---but, as far as\\n  anyone knows, there is no easy way to compute D_K from the pair\\n  (pq,e). So whoever generates K can publish (pq,e). Anyone can send a\\n  secret message to him; he is the only one who can read the messages.\\n\\n* Is RSA secure?\\n\\n  Nobody knows. An obvious attack on RSA is to factor pq into p and q.\\n  See below for comments on how fast state-of-the-art factorization\\n  algorithms run. Unfortunately nobody has the slightest idea how to\\n  prove that factorization---or any realistic problem at all, for that\\n  matter---is inherently slow. It is easy to formalize what we mean by\\n  ``RSA is/isn't strong''; but, as Hendrik W. Lenstra, Jr., says,\\n  ``Exact definitions appear to be necessary only when one wishes to\\n  prove that algorithms with certain properties do _not_ exist, and\\n  theoretical computer science is notoriously lacking in such negative\\n  results.''\\n\\n* How fast can people factor numbers?\\n\\n  It depends on the size of the numbers. In October 1992 Arjen Lenstra\\n  and Dan Bernstein factored 2^523 - 1 into primes, using about three\\n  weeks of MasPar time. (The MasPar is a 16384-processor SIMD machine;\\n  each processor can add about 200000 integers per second.) The\\n  algorithm there is called the ``number field sieve''; it is quite a\\n  bit faster for special numbers like 2^523 - 1 than for general numbers\\n  n, but it takes time only about exp(O(log^{1/3} n log^{2/3} log n)) in\\n  any case.\\n\\n  An older and more popular method for smaller numbers is the ``multiple\\n  polynomial quadratic sieve'', which takes time exp(O(log^{1/2} n\\n  log^{1/2} log n))---faster than the number field sieve for small n,\\n  but slower for large n. The breakeven point is somewhere between 100\\n  and 150 digits, depending on the implementations.\\n\\n  Factorization is a fast-moving field---the state of the art just a few\\n  years ago was nowhere near as good as it is now. If no new methods are\\n  developed, then 2048-bit RSA keys will always be safe from\\n  factorization, but one can't predict the future. (Before the number\\n  field sieve was found, many people conjectured that the quadratic\\n  sieve was asymptotically as fast as any factoring method could be.)\\n\\n* What about other public-key cryptosystems?\\n\\n  We've talked about RSA because it's well known and easy to describe.\\n  But there are lots of other public-key systems around, many of which\\n  are faster than RSA or depend on problems more widely believed to be\\n  difficult. This has been just a brief introduction; if you really want\\n  to learn about the many facets of public-key cryptography, consult the\\n  books and journal articles listed in part 10.\\n\",\n",

Whenever I save an icon which contains dark\\ncolors like dark red or dark purple, these colors are converted to the\\nbright colors. This happens with every icon editor including the image\\neditor that came with SDK. I don't have this problem with .BMP files\\neither; only with .ICO files or icon libraries. The problem is with\\nthe icon colormap field in the icon file header. Checking the file\\nwith a binary editor, I can see that the masks are OK. By editing the\\ncolormap manually (copying from another icon that I didn't edit) I can\\nfix the colors. Does anybody know what may be causing this problem? \\n\\nThanks.\\n\\n\\n\\n--\\nSadun Anik, U of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\\nCenter for Reliable and High-performance Computing\\ne-mail: anik@crhc.uiuc.edu\\n\",\n",

Maybe\\n\\nPC Magazine, January 12, 1993 had a review of several personal finance\\nmanagement programe, as did PC-Computing, January 1993.  PC World,\\nDecember 1992 also had articles about Quicken and Managing Your Money.\\nI can email you copies of these articles if you can\\'t find them at your\\nlibrary.\\n\\nI\\'ve been using Managing Your Money for several years, and I have\\nseveral friends who use Quicken, though I\\'ve not used it myself.  My\\noverall impression is that Quicken is a financial accounts manager\\nwhile Managing Your Money will help you more completely manage your\\nfinances.\\n\\nHere are some features that I believe Managing Your Money and Quicken share:\\n\\n\\tThe ability to keep records for each of your financial accounts:\\n\\tchecking, savings, charge, cash, or brokerage.  You can reconcile\\n\\tyour account statements with the records the program keeps.\\n\\n\\tThe ability to make a budget and track your spending against that\\n\\tbudget.\\n\\n\\tA Checkfree module which will allow you to use the Checkfree bill\\n\\tpaying service to pay your bills via your modem.\\n\\t\\n\\tThe ability to print checks on your printer.\\n\\n\\tThe ability to keep loan records and set up automatic loan payments.\\n\\n\\tThe ability to import stock quotations to keep your brokerage accounts\\n\\tup to date.  I know Managing Your Money can do this automatically\\n\\tvia modem.  Quicken probably can as well, but I\\'m not sure about it.\\n\\n\\tThe ability to export tax information to popular tax preparation\\n\\tprograms.\\n\\n\\nHere are some features that I believe Managing Your Money has that\\nQuicken does not:\\n\\n\\tA tax prediction module.  This looks at your accounts and budget to\\n\\tpredict your tax liability for the coming year.  It\\'s usefull to fine\\n\\ttune your withholding so Uncle Sam doesn\\'t get his due too early.\\n\\n\\tAn insurance and vital records module.  This is a place to keep\\n\\trecords of your insurance policies as well as other vital records.\\n\\tIt can also compute your life expectancy.\\n\\n\\tA financial analysis module.  This computes compound interest, \\n\\teffects of inflation, loan payments term or interest, yield to\\n\\tmaturity for bonds, savings account yields, days between dates, and\\n\\tloan amortization schedules.  It also has functions to help you \\n\\tdecide whether to refinance your mortgage, whether you can afford\\n\\ta particular home, whether a particular rental property is a good\\n\\tinvestment, whether you should buy lease or rent, and whether\\n\\ta particular investment\\'s cash flow is adequate for your situation.\\n\\tThis module can also help you plan for retirement and for helping\\n\\tyour kids with their tuition.  \\n\\n\\tA net worth module.  This is a place to record all your assets\\n\\tand liabilities.  Your net worth can be computed from this \\n\\tinformation.  Any assets or liabilities recorded in other modules\\n\\tare automatically included here.\\n\\n\\tA \"desk\" module.  This includes a small word processor, a card file\\n\\tyou can use to store names, addresses, phone numbers and other vital\\n\\tinformation about friends and associates, a perpetual calander, a\\n\\trudimentary calculator, a to-do list, a reminder list, an appointment\\n\\tlist, and a place to record your phone calls (for those who need to\\n\\ttrack such things).  Your appointments, reminders and to-do list\\n\\tcan be made to display automatically when you start the program.\\n\\nThere are probably some things listed above that Quicken has, but I\\'m almost\\nsure that Quicken doesn\\'t do everything I\\'ve listed.  If I\\'m wrong, I\\'m sure\\nhordes of Quicken devotees will flame me to a crisp.\\n\\nOne thing that Quicken has that Managing Your Money does not yet have is a \\nWindows version.  MECA software is rumored to be working on a Windows version\\nof Managing Your Money for release late this year.\\n\\nI hope this information is of use to you.  I\\'ve found Managing Your Money to\\nbe a very usefull program for keeping my financial records.  On the other hand\\nI know many people who are equally as happy with Quicken.  If Quicken has all\\nthe features you need or want, I\\'d go with it. If you find any of the Managing\\nYour Money features that Quicken doesn\\'t have to be useful, I think it\\'s well\\nworth the price.\\n',\n",

I found out about it when the FBI briefed me on\\nThursday evening, April 15.  Since then I have spent considerable\\ntime talking with the NSA and FBI to learn more about this, and I\\nattended the NIST briefing at the Department of Commerce on April 16.  \\nThe document below is the result of that effort. \\n\\nDorothy Denning\\n---------------\\n\\n                     THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY\\n\\n                               Dorothy Denning\\n\\n                                April 19, 1993\\n\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\n\\nOn April 16, the President announced a new initiative that will bring\\ntogether the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program\\nto provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of\\nlaw enforcement.  At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption\\nchip called the \"Clipper Chip\" together with a split-key approach to\\nescrowing keys.  Two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts from\\nboth are needed to reconstruct a key.\\n\\n\\nCHIP STRUCTURE\\n\\nThe Clipper Chip contains a classified 64-bit block encryption\\nalgorithm called \"Skipjack.\"  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared\\nwith 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16\\nfor the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  Throughput is\\n16 Mbits a second.\\n\\nEach chip includes the following components:\\n\\n   the Skipjack encryption algorithm\\n   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips\\n   N, a 30-bit serial number\\n   U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip\\n\\n\\nENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP\\n\\nTo see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T\\ntelephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and\\nwe both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure\\nconversation, my security device will negotiate a session key K with\\nthe device at the other end (in general, any method of key exchange can\\nbe used).  The key K and message stream M (i.e., digitized voice) are then\\nfed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values:\\n\\n   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and \\n   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.  \\n\\nThe law enforcement block thus contains the session key K encrypted\\nunder the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N, all\\nencrypted under the family key F.\\n\\n\\nCHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW\\n\\nAll Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (secure computer\\ninformation facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains\\na laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips\\nare programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at\\nMikotronx.\\n\\nAt the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key\\nescrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters an 80-bit value S1\\ninto the laptop and agent 2 enters an 80-bit value S2. These values\\nserve as seeds to generate keys for a sequence of serial numbers.\\n\\nTo generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is\\nfirst padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.\\nS1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a\\n64-bit block R1:\\n\\n        R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .\\n\\nSimilarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and\\nN3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:  \\n\\n        R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1] \\n        R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .\\n\\nR1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The\\nfirst 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The\\nrest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2\\nare the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow\\nagencies.\\n\\nAs a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are\\nwritten onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a\\nfile for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part\\nU1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third\\ndisk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent\\n2 takes the second disk.  The third disk is used to program the chips.\\nAfter the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the\\nvault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional\\nassurance that no information is left behind.\\n \\nThe protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the\\nroom instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,\\nand the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to\\nthe escrow agencies.\\n\\nThe escrow agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will not\\nbe the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency.  One or\\nboth may be independent from the government.\\n\\n\\nLAW ENFORCEMENT USE\\n\\nWhen law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they\\nwill first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get\\naccess to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in\\nplace and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with\\nClipper.  They will first decrypt the law enforcement block with the\\nfamily key F.  This gives them E[K; U] + N.  They will then take a\\nwarrant identifying the chip serial number N to each of the key escrow\\nagents and get back U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed together to produce\\nthe unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the session key K.\\nFinally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will be accomplished\\nthrough a special black box decoder operated by the FBI.\\n\\n\\nACKNOWLEDGMENT AND DISTRIBUTION NOTICE.  All information is based on\\ninformation provided by NSA, NIST, and the FBI.  Permission to\\ndistribute this document is granted.\\n\\n\\n    \\n',\n",

Full\\n  descriptions are given in Bennett [BEN87] and Bergen and Caelli\\n  [BER91].\\n\\n  Chris Galas writes: ``Someone awhile back was looking for a way to\\n  decrypt WordPerfect document files and I think I have a solution. \\n  There is a software company named: Accessdata (87 East 600 South,\\n  Orem, UT 84058), 1-800-658-5199 that has a software package that will\\n  decrypt any WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3, Quatro-Pro, MS Excel and Paradox\\n  files. The cost of the package is $185. Steep prices, but if you\\n  think your pw key is less than 10 characters, (or 10 char) give them a\\n  call and ask for the free demo disk. The demo disk will decrypt files\\n  that have a 10 char or less pw key.\\'\\'\\n\\n* How do I break a Vigenere (repeated-key) cipher?\\n\\n  A repeated-key cipher, where the ciphertext is something like the\\n  plaintext xor KEYKEYKEYKEY (and so on), is called a Vigenere cipher.\\n  If the key is not too long and the plaintext is in English, do the\\n  following: \\n\\n  1. Discover the length of the key by counting coincidences.\\n  (See Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].) Trying each displacement of\\n  the ciphertext against itself, count those bytes which are equal. \\n  If the two ciphertext portions have used the same key, something\\n  over 6% of the bytes will be equal. If they have used different\\n  key, then less than 0.4% will be equal (assuming random 8-bit bytes\\n  of key covering normal ASCII text). The smallest displacement which\\n  indicates an equal key is the length of the repeated key.\\n\\n  2. Shift the text by that length and XOR it with itself. This\\n  removes the key and leaves you with text XORed with itself. Since\\n  English has about 1 bit of real information per byte, 2 streams of\\n  text XORed together has 2 bits of info per 8-bit byte, providing\\n  plenty of redundancy for choosing a unique decryption. (And in fact\\n  one stream of text XORed with itself has just 1 bit per byte.)\\n\\n  If the key is short, it might be even easier to treat this as a\\n  standard polyalphabetic substitution. All the old cryptanalysis\\n  texts show how to break those. It\\'s possible with those methods, in\\n  the hands of an expert, if there\\'s only ten times as much text as key.\\n  See, for example, Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].\\n\\n* How do I send encrypted mail under UNIX? [PGP, RIPEM, PEM, ...]\\n\\n  Here\\'s one popular method, using the des command:\\n\\n    cat file | compress | des private_key | uuencode | mail\\n\\n  Meanwhile, there is a de jure Internet standard in the works called\\n  PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail). It is described in RFCs 1421 through\\n  1424. To join the PEM mailing list, contact pem-dev-request@tis.com.\\n  There is a beta version of PEM being tested at the time of this\\n  writing.\\n\\n  There are also two programs available in the public domain for encrypting\\n  mail: PGP and RIPEM.  Both are available by FTP.  Each has its own\\n  newsgroup: alt.security.pgp and alt.security.ripem.  Each has its own FAQ\\n  as well.\\n\\n  PGP is most commonly used outside the USA since it uses the RSA algorithm\\n  without a license and RSA\\'s patent is valid only (or at least primarily)\\n  in the USA.\\n\\n  RIPEM is most commonly used inside the USA since it uses the RSAREF which\\n  is freely available within the USA but not available for shipment outside\\n  the USA.\\n\\n  Since both programs use a secret key algorithm for encrypting the body of\\n  the message (PGP used IDEA; RIPEM uses DES) and RSA for encrypting the\\n  message key, they should be able to interoperate freely.  Although there\\n  have been repeated calls for each to understand the other\\'s formats and\\n  algorithm choices, no interoperation is available at this time (as far as\\n  we know).\\n\\n* Is the UNIX crypt command secure?\\n\\n  No. See [REE84]. There is a program available called cbw (crypt\\n  breaker\\'s workbench) which can be used to do ciphertext-only attacks\\n  on files encrypted with crypt. One source for CBW is [FTPCB].\\n\\n* How do I use compression with encryption?\\n\\n  A number of people have proposed doing perfect compression followed by\\n  some simple encryption method (e.g., XOR with a repeated key).\\n\\n  Unfortunately, you can only compress perfectly if you know the exact\\n  distribution of possible inputs. For all practical purposes it\\'s\\n  impossible to describe ``the typical English text\\'\\' beyond coarse\\n  characteristics such as single-letter frequencies. You can build up\\n  more and more sophisticated models of your inputs, but if the enemy\\n  has a slightly more accurate model, he\\'ll be able to find some\\n  redundancy in your compressed output.\\n\\n  Note that nearly all practical compression schemes, unless they\\n  have been designed with cryptography in mind, produce output that\\n  actually starts off with high redundancy. For example, the output of\\n  UNIX compress begins with a well-known three-byte ``magic number\\'\\'\\n  that can serve as an entering wedge for cryptanalysis.\\n  \\n  This is not to say that compression before encryption is inherently a\\n  bad idea; it just has to be done very, very carefully, and by no means\\n  removes the need for strong encryption.\\n\\n  Compression after encryption is silly.\\n\\n* Is there an unbreakable cipher?\\n\\n  Yes. The one-time pad is unbreakable; see part 4. Unfortunately the\\n  one-time pad requires secure distribution of as much key material as\\n  plaintext.\\n\\n  Of course, a cryptosystem need not be utterly unbreakable to be\\n  useful. Rather, it needs to be strong enough to resist attacks by\\n  likely enemies for whatever length of time the data it protects is\\n  expected to remain valid.\\n\\n* What does ``random\\'\\' mean in cryptography?\\n\\n  Cryptographic applications demand much more out of a pseudorandom\\n  number generator than most applications. For a source of bits to be\\n  cryptographically random, it must be computationally impossible to\\n  predict what the Nth random bit will be given complete knowledge of\\n  the algorithm or hardware generating the stream and the sequence of\\n  0th through N-1st bits, for all N up to the lifetime of the source.\\n\\n  A software generator (also known as pseudo-random) has the function\\n  of expanding a truly random seed to a longer string of apparently\\n  random bits.  This seed must be large enough not to be guessed by\\n  the opponent.  Ideally, it should also be truly random (perhaps\\n  generated by a hardware random number source).\\n\\n  Those who have Sparcstation 1 workstations could, for example,\\n  generate random numbers using the audio input device as a source of\\n  entropy, by not connecting anything to it.  For example,\\n\\n\\tcat /dev/audio | compress - >foo\\n\\n  gives a file of high entropy (not random but with much randomness in\\n  it).  One can then encrypt that file using part of itself as a key,\\n  for example, to convert that seed entropy into a pseudo-random\\n  string.\\n\\n  When looking for hardware devices to provide this entropy, it is\\n  important really to measure the entropy rather than just assume that\\n  because it looks complicated to a human, it must be \"random\".  For\\n  example, disk operation completion times sound like they might be\\n  unpredictable (to many people) but a spinning disk is much like a\\n  clock and its output completion times are relatively low in entropy.\\n\\n* What is the unicity point (a.k.a. unicity distance)?\\n\\n  See [SHA49]. The unicity distance is an approximation to that amount\\n  of ciphertext such that the sum of the real information (entropy) in\\n  the corresponding source text and encryption key equals the number\\n  of ciphertext bits used. Ciphertexts significantly longer than this\\n  can be shown probably to have a unique decipherment. This is used to\\n  back up a claim of the validity of a ciphertext-only cryptanalysis. \\n  Ciphertexts significantly shorter than this are likely to have\\n  multiple, equally valid decryptions and therefore to gain security\\n  from the opponent\\'s difficulty choosing the correct one.\\n\\n  Unicity distance, like all statistical or information-theoretic\\n  measures, does not make deterministic predictions but rather gives\\n  probabilistic results: namely, the minimum amount of ciphertext\\n  for which it is likely that there is only a single intelligible\\n  plaintext corresponding to the ciphertext, when all possible keys\\n  are tried for the decryption. Working cryptologists don\\'t normally\\n  deal with unicity distance as such. Instead they directly determine\\n  the likelihood of events of interest.\\n\\n  Let the unicity distance of a cipher be D characters. If fewer than\\n  D ciphertext characters have been intercepted, then there is not\\n  enough information to distinguish the real key from a set of\\n  possible keys. DES has a unicity distance of 17.5 characters,\\n  which is less than 3 ciphertext blocks (each block corresponds to\\n  8 ASCII characters). This may seem alarmingly low at first, but\\n  the unicity distance gives no indication of the computational work\\n  required to find the key after approximately D characters have been\\n  intercepted.\\n\\n  In fact, actual cryptanalysis seldom proceeds along the lines used\\n  in discussing unicity distance. (Like other measures such as key\\n  size, unicity distance is something that guarantees insecurity if\\n  it\\'s too small, but doesn\\'t guarantee security if it\\'s high.) Few\\n  practical cryptosystems are absolutely impervious to analysis; all\\n  manner of characteristics might serve as entering ``wedges\\'\\' to crack\\n  some cipher messages. However, similar information-theoretic\\n  considerations are occasionally useful, for example, to determine a\\n  recommended key change interval for a particular cryptosystem.\\n  Cryptanalysts also employ a variety of statistical and\\n  information-theoretic tests to help guide the analysis in the most\\n  promising directions.\\n\\n  Unfortunately, most literature on the application of information\\n  statistics to cryptanalysis remains classified, even the seminal\\n  1940 work of Alan Turing (see [KOZ84]). For some insight into the\\n  possibilities, see [KUL68] and [GOO83].\\n\\n* What is key management and why is it important?\\n\\n  One of the fundamental axioms of cryptography is that the enemy is in\\n  full possession of the details of the general cryptographic system,\\n  and lacks only the specific key data employed in the encryption. (Of\\n  course, one would assume that the CIA does not make a habit of telling\\n  Mossad about its cryptosystems, but Mossad probably finds out anyway.)\\n  Repeated use of a finite amount of key provides redundancy that can\\n  eventually facilitate cryptanalytic progress. Thus, especially in\\n  modern communication systems where vast amounts of information are\\n  transferred, both parties must have not only a sound cryptosystem but\\n  also enough key material to cover the traffic.\\n\\n  Key management refers to the distribution, authentication, and\\n  handling of keys.\\n\\n  A publicly accessible example of modern key management technology\\n  is the STU III secure telephone unit, which for classified use\\n  employs individual coded ``Crypto Ignition Keys\\'\\' and a central Key\\n  Management Center operated by NSA. There is a hierarchy in that\\n  certain CIKs are used by authorized cryptographic control\\n  personnel to validate the issuance of individual traffic keys and\\n  to perform installation/maintenance functions, such as the\\n  reporting of lost CIKs.\\n\\n  This should give an inkling of the extent of the key management\\n  problem. For public-key systems, there are several related issues,\\n  many having to do with ``whom do you trust?\\'\\'\\n\\n* Can I use pseudo-random or chaotic numbers as a key stream?\\n\\n  Chaotic equations and fractals produce an apparent randomness from\\n  relatively compact generators. Perhaps the simplest example is a\\n  linear congruential sequence, one of the most popular types of random\\n  number generators, where there is no obvious dependence between seeds\\n  and outputs. Unfortunately the graph of any such sequence will, in a\\n  high enough dimension, show up as a regular lattice. Mathematically\\n  this lattice corresponds to structure which is notoriously easy for\\n  cryptanalysts to exploit. More complicated generators have more\\n  complicated structure, which is why they make interesting pictures---\\n  but a cryptographically strong sequence will have no computable\\n  structure at all.\\n\\n  See [KNU81], exercise 3.5-7; [REE77]; and [BOY89].\\n\\n* What is the correct frequency list for English letters?\\n\\n  There are three answers to this question, each slightly deeper than\\n  the one before. You can find the first answer in various books:\\n  namely, a frequency list computed directly from a certain sample of\\n  English text. Of course any such list will be ``correctly\\'\\' computed,\\n  but exactly which list you get depends on which sample was taken.\\n\\n  The second answer is that the question doesn\\'t make sense. What do\\n  you mean by ``English letters\\'\\'? The ``English language\\'\\' is not a\\n  fixed, finite, closed object that can be exactly characterized. It\\n  has changed over time; it is different between different authors.\\n  Any particular message will have different statistics from those of\\n  the language as a whole.\\n\\n  The third answer is that yes, no particular message is going to have\\n  exactly the same characteristics as English in general, but for all\\n  reasonable statistical uses these slight discrepancies won\\'t matter.\\n  In fact there\\'s an entire field called ``Bayesian statistics\\'\\' (other\\n  buzzwords are ``maximum entropy methods\\'\\' and ``maximum likelihood\\n  estimation\\'\\') which studies questions like ``What\\'s the chance that a\\n  text with these letter frequencies is in English?\\'\\' and comes up with\\n  reasonably robust answers.\\n\\n  So make your own list from your own samples of English text. It will\\n  be good enough for practical work, if you use it properly.\\n\\n* What is the Enigma?\\n\\n  ``For a project in data security we are looking for sources of\\n  information about the German Enigma code and how it was broken by\\n  the British during WWII.\\'\\'\\n\\n  See [WEL82], [DEA85], [KOZ84], [HOD83], [KAH91].\\n\\n* How do I shuffle cards?\\n\\n  Card shuffling is a special case of the permutation of an array of\\n  values, using a random or pseudo-random function.  All possible output\\n  permutations of this process should be equally likely.  To do this, you\\n  need a random function (modran(x)) which will produce a uniformly\\n  distributed random integer in the interval [0..x-1].  Given that\\n  function, you can shuffle with the following [C] code: (assuming ARRLTH\\n  is the length of array arr[] and swap() interchanges values at the two\\n  addresses given)\\n\\n  for ( n = ARRLTH-1; n > 0 ; n-- ) swap( &arr[modran( n+1 )], &arr[n] ) ;\\n\\n  modran(x) can not be achieved exactly with a simple (ranno() % x) since\\n  ranno()\\'s interval may not be divisible by x, although in most cases the\\n  error will be very small.  To cover this case, one can take ranno()\\'s\\n  modulus mod x, call that number y, and if ranno() returns a value less\\n  than y, go back and get another ranno() value.\\n\\n\\n* Can I foil S/W pirates by encrypting my CD-ROM?\\n\\n  Someone will frequently express the desire to publish a CD-ROM with\\n  possibly multiple pieces of software, perhaps with each encrypted\\n  separately, and will want to use different keys for each user (perhaps\\n  even good for only a limited period of time) in order to avoid piracy.\\n\\n  As far as we know, this is impossible, since there is nothing in standard\\n  PC or workstation hardware which uniquely identifies the user at the\\n  keyboard.  If there were such an identification, then the CD-ROM could be\\n  encrypted with a key based in part on the one sold to the user and in\\n  part on the unique identifier.  However, in this case the CD-ROM is one\\n  of a kind and that defeats the intended purpose.\\n\\n  If the CD-ROM is to be encrypted once and then mass produced, there must\\n  be a key (or set of keys) for that encryption produced at some stage in\\n  the process.  That key is useable with any copy of the CD-ROM\\'s data.\\n  The pirate needs only to isolate that key and sell it along with the\\n  illegal copy.\\n\\n\\n* Can you do automatic cryptanalysis of simple ciphers?\\n\\n  schneier@chinet.chi.il.us (Bruce Schneier) says: AccessData of Orem,\\n  Utah sells products that break the password scheme of a number of\\n  popular Macintosh and PC software packages.

And key size is one of the things that can be\\nverified externally.  Feed lots of random key/input pairs into the\\nchip, then try flipping random key bits, and see what happens to the\\noutput.  We already know what *should* happen -- about half the output\\nbits should vary, on average, from a 1-bit key change or input change.\\n\\nIf they were out to build a weak cryptosystem, it might be the case that\\nsome of the bits are much less powerful than others, in the sense that\\nthey only enter into the encryption very late in the game.  By contrast,\\nDES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible; the 50% output\\nchange rate appears as early as round 5.  Again, though, I don't think\\nNSA is going to cheat that crudely; they're likely to get caught.\\n\\nRemember that they've promised to let a committee of outside experts see\\nthe cryptosystem design.  If you assume something DES-like, a biased\\nsubkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb.  The committee\\ncan and should run lots of tests, and retain the output.  This can be verified\\nlater against the chip.  And yes, the civilian community has at least some\\nsecure storage facilities that I don't think even NSA can get into without\\nit being noticed, until Fort Meade gets its transporter working again.\\n(Oops -- I don't think I was supposed to talk about that...)  The committee\\nmembers can even retain secure copies of the code -- in two halves, which\\nyou have to XOR together to recover the program...\\n\\nSeriously, there are, I think, problems with this whole scheme.  But the\\npeople who invented it aren't stupid, and they've been in the crypto game\\nand the smoke-and-mirrors game far longer than most of us.  They're not\\ngoing to lie in ways that can be detected easily, since their credibility\\nis the *only* thing they can use to sell this system.  If they've lied\\nabout the civilian committee, no one will believe them about the absence\\nof other back doors.  If they've lied about the key size, no one will\\nbelieve that they haven't copied the programming disk with the U keys.\\nIf they've lied about obvious aspects of the strength of the cryptosystem,\\nno one will believe the escrow agencies aren't in cahoots with them.\\n\\nThat isn't to say that they aren't lying about all those other things\\nanyway.  And I'm certainly not claiming that NSA can't build a cryptosystem\\nwith a back door that the committee can't find -- look how long it took\\nfor folks to believe that the S-boxes weren't sabotaged.

Once again, to not believe in God is different than saying  \\nI BELIEVE that God does not exist. I still maintain the position, even \\nafter reading the FAQs, that strong atheism requires faith.\\n\\nBut first let me say the following.\\nWe might have a language problem here - in regards to \"faith\" and\\n\"existence\". I, as a Christian, maintain that God does not exist.\\nTo exist means to have being in space and time. God does not HAVE\\nbeing - God IS Being. Kierkegaard once said that God does not\\nexist, He is eternal. With this said, I feel it\\'s rather pointless\\nto debate the so called \"existence\" of God - and that is not what\\nI\\'m doing here. I believe that God is the source and ground of\\nbeing. When you say that \"god does not exist\", I also accept this\\nstatement - but we obviously mean two different things by it. However,\\nin what follows I will use the phrase \"the existence of God\" in it\\'s\\n\\'usual sense\\' - and this is the sense that I think you are using it.\\nI would like a clarification upon what you mean by \"the existence of\\nGod\".\\n \\nWe also might differ upon what it means to have faith. Here is what\\nWebster says:\\n\\nfaith \\n1a: allegiance to duty or a person: LOYALTY\\nb  (1): fidelity to one\\'s promises\\n   (2): sincerity of intentions\\n2a (1): belief and trust in and loyalty to God\\n   (2): belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion\\nb  (1): firm belief in something for which there is no proof\\n        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n   (2): complete trust\\n3: something that is believed esp. with strong conviction; esp: a system \\n   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nof religious beliefs\\nsyn see BELIEF\\n\\n\\n\\nOne can never prove that God does or does not exist. When you say\\nthat you believe God does not exist, and that this is an opinion\\n\"based upon observation\", I will have to ask \"what observtions are\\nyou refering to?\" There are NO observations - pro or con - that\\nare valid here in establishing a POSITIVE belief. All observations\\ncan only point you in a direction - a direction that we might even\\nbe predisposed to (by predisposed I mean, for example, people whoes \\npartents \"believe in God\" also tend to). To actually draw a conclusion\\nabout the \"existence\" or \"non-existence\" of God requires a leap - and\\nyou have made this leap when you actively say \"I believe that God  \\ndoes/does not exist\". Personally, I think that both statements are\\nmisguided. Arguing over the \"existence\" of God is precisely the wrong way\\nto find Him (and yes, I use \"Him\" because a personal God is the only \\nviable concept (IMO) - if a person wants to use \"She\" go ahead. Of course \\nGod is neither He nor She - but we have no choice but to \\nanthropomorphise. If you want me to explain myself further I\\'ll be \\nglad to.) \\n\\n\\n\\nAnd please, if someone does not agree with me - even if they violently \\ndisagree - it\\'s in no ones advantage to start name calling.

Rather than use technology to accommodate\\nthe sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and\\nlaw enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against\\nindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.\\n\\nSophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to\\nprotect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to\\nprotect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption\\ntechnology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\\nunauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\\nby terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\\n\\nA state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"Clipper Chip\" has\\nbeen developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a\\nnew approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,\\nrelatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\\nan ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications\\nusing an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in\\ncommercial use today.\\n\\nThis new technology will help companies protect proprietary\\ninformation, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations\\nand prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted\\nelectronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the\\nability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to\\nintercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. \\n\\nA \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the\\n\"Clipper Chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding\\nAmericans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique\\n\\n\\n                                2\\n\\n\\n\"keys,\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government\\nagencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the\\ndevice is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately\\nin two \"key-escrow\" data bases that will be established by the\\nAttorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to\\ngovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct a\\nwiretap.\\n\\nThe \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with no\\nnew authorities to access the content of the private\\nconversations of Americans.\\n\\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the\\nAttorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new\\ndevices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the\\ngovernment will be offered access to the confidential details of\\nthe algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report\\ntheir findings.\\n\\nThe chip is an important step in addressing the problem of\\nencryption\\'s dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the\\nprivacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield\\ncriminals and terrorists.  We need the \"Clipper Chip\" and other\\napproaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access\\nto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it\\nto hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology\\ntrends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),\\nthe President has directed government agencies to develop a\\ncomprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:\\n\\n     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to\\n          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;\\n\\n     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone\\n          calls and data, under proper court or other legal\\n          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;\\n\\n     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern\\n          technology to build the National Information\\n          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and\\n          the competitiveness of American industry in the global\\n          marketplace; and \\n\\n     --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export\\n          high technology products.\\n\\nThe President has directed early and frequent consultations with\\naffected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the\\nprivacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                3\\n\\nThe Administration is committed to working with the private\\nsector to spur the development of a National Information\\nInfrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer\\ntechnologies to give Americans unprecedented access to\\ninformation.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks\\n(\"information superhighways\") will transmit video, images, HDTV\\nprogramming, and huge data files as easily as today\\'s telephone\\nsystem transmits voice.\\n\\nSince encryption technology will play an increasingly important\\nrole in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act\\nquickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding\\nits use.  The Administration is committed to policies that\\nprotect all Americans\\' right to privacy while also protecting\\nthem from those who break the law.\\n\\nFurther information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. \\nThe provisions of the President\\'s directive to acquire the new\\nencryption technology are also available.  \\n\\nFor additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of\\nStandards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.\\n\\n---------------------------------\\n\\n\\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION\\'S\\nTELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQ:   Does this approach expand the authority of government\\n     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?\\n\\nA:   No.  \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with\\n     no new authorities to access the content of the private\\n     conversations of Americans.\\n\\nQ:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\\n     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\\n     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\\n     decipher the message?\\n\\nA:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\\n     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They\\n     would then present documentation of this authorization to\\n     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and\\n     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug\\n     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are\\n     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key\\n     escrow system.\\n\\nQ:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?\\n\\nA:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent\\n     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the\\n     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will\\n     oversee the key-escrow data banks.\\n\\nQ:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure\\n     how strong the security is?  \\n\\nA:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption\\n     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will\\n     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow\\n     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of\\n     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all\\n     potential users that there are no unrecognized\\n     vulnerabilities.\\n\\nQ:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?\\n\\nA:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the\\n     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in\\n     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the\\n     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet\\n     officials.\\n\\nQ:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?\\n\\nA:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on\\n     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify\\n     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have\\n     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the\\n     decisions related to this initiative.\\n\\nQ:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?\\n\\nA:   The government designed and developed the key access\\n     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the\\n     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product\\n     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip\\n     manufacturer that produces them.\\n\\nQ:   Who provides the \"Clipper Chip\"?\\n\\nA:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,\\n     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device\\n     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed\\n     to other vendors in the future.\\n\\nQ:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? \\n\\nA:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating\\n     the \"Clipper Chip\" into their devices.\\n     \\nQ:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological\\n     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be\\n     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more\\n     powerful encryption devices?\\n\\nA:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be\\n     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow\\n     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product\\n     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive\\n     than others readily available today, but it is just one\\n     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to\\n     encryption technology, which the Administration is\\n     developing.\\n\\n     The Administration is not saying, \"since encryption\\n     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,\\n     we will prohibit it outright\" (as some countries have\\n     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \"every\\n     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an\\n     unbreakable commercial encryption product.\"  There is a\\n     false \"tension\" created in the assessment that this issue is\\n     an \"either-or\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,\\n     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,\\n     balanced approach such as is proposed with the \"Clipper\\n     Chip\" and similar encryption techniques.\\n\\nQ:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton\\n     Administration\\'s policy toward encryption will differ from\\n     that of the Bush Administration?  \\n\\nA:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption\\n     technology in telecommunications and computing and are\\n     committed to working with industry and public-interest\\n     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans\\'\\n     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law\\n     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime\\n     and terrorism.\\n\\nQ:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use\\n     the government hardware?\\n\\nA:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control\\n     requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is\\n     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The\\n     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the\\n     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give\\n     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this\\n     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a\\n     case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these\\n     devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan\\n     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability\\n     of these products.\\n\\n \\n     \\n',\n",

Well, I now have the\\nopportunity to write some font rendering software so I would like to have\\nsome of my questions answered before I jump into the deep end.\\n\\nThe main problem I face is how to use the even/odd or non-winding rules to\\nturn the outlines into a single outline polygon (my renderer can handle\\ncomplex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simple\\npolygons). For example, in the letter \"O\" there are two outlines:\\n\\n\\t1) The outside outline which is clockwise (TrueType font)\\n\\t2) The inside outline which is counterclockwise.\\n\\nOne common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply \\nconnect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the\\ntwo outlines are closest. This is equivalent to descibing a \"polygon with\\nholes\". The renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior\\npolygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges.\\n\\nI do not want to use this simplistic system since:\\n\\n\\t1) It will not handle all outline fonts properly (it is not a simple\\n\\t\\tmatter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for\\n\\t\\tsome fancy fonts).\\n\\t2) It does not properly handle the even/odd or non-winding rules.\\n\\nFrom my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoid\\ndecomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids (as\\nis done by the Postscript and TrueType font rasterizers). These trapezoidal\\npolygons can then be easily and properly rendered by the 3D scanline renderer.\\n\\nMy question is: are there any better solutions to turning the outlines into\\npolgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer? I am not fond of this solution\\nsince it creates excess number of polygons.\\n\\nAnother question, for those in the know: what is the best algorithm to create\\nbevelled and/or offset curves for font outlines?

Encryption? Key?\\n* What references can I start with to learn cryptology?\\n* How does one go about cryptanalysis?\\n* What is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance?\\n* What are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem?\\n* If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable, then is it\\n  guaranteed analysis-proof in practice?\\n* Why are many people still using cryptosystems that are\\n  relatively easy to break?\\n\\n\\n* What is cryptology? Cryptography? Plaintext? Ciphertext? Encryption? Key?\\n\\n  The story begins: When Julius Caesar sent messages to his trusted\\n  acquaintances, he didn't trust the messengers. So he replaced every A\\n  by a C, every B by a D, and so on through the alphabet. Only someone\\n  who knew the ``shift by 2'' rule could decipher his messages.\\n\\n  A cryptosystem or cipher system is a method of disguising messages so\\n  that only certain people can see through the disguise. Cryptography is\\n  the art of creating and using cryptosystems. Cryptanalysis is the art\\n  of breaking cryptosystems---seeing through the disguise even when\\n  you're not supposed to be able to. Cryptology is the study of both\\n  cryptography and cryptanalysis.\\n\\n  The original message is called a plaintext. The disguised message is\\n  called a ciphertext. Encryption means any procedure to convert\\n  plaintext into ciphertext. Decryption means any procedure to convert\\n  ciphertext into plaintext.\\n\\n  A cryptosystem is usually a whole collection of algorithms. The\\n  algorithms are labelled; the labels are called keys. For instance,\\n  Caesar probably used ``shift by n'' encryption for several different\\n  values of n. It's natural to say that n is the key here.\\n\\n  The people who are supposed to be able to see through the disguise are\\n  called recipients. Other people are enemies, opponents, interlopers,\\n  eavesdroppers, or third parties.\\n\\n* What references can I start with to learn cryptology?\\n\\n  For an introduction to technical matter, the survey articles given\\n  in part 10 are the best place to begin as they are, in general,\\n  concise, authored by competent people, and well written. However,\\n  these articles are mostly concerned with cryptology as it has\\n  developed in the last 50 years or so, and are more abstract and\\n  mathematical than historical. The Codebreakers by Kahn [KAH67] is\\n  encyclopedic in its history and technical detail of cryptology up\\n  to the mid-60's.\\n\\n  Introductory cryptanalysis can be learned from Gaines [GAI44] or\\n  Sinkov [SIN66]. This is recommended especially for people who want\\n  to devise their own encryption algorithms since it is a common\\n  mistake to try to make a system before knowing how to break one.\\n\\n  The selection of an algorithm for the DES drew the attention of\\n  many public researchers to problems in cryptology. Consequently\\n  several textbooks and books to serve as texts have appeared. The\\n  book of Denning [DEN82] gives a good introduction to a broad range\\n  of security including encryption algorithms, database security,\\n  access control, and formal models of security. Similar comments\\n  apply to the books of Price & Davies [PRI84] and Pfleeger [PFL89].\\n\\n  The books of Konheim [KON81] and Meyer & Matyas [MEY82] are quite\\n  technical books. Both Konheim and Meyer were directly involved in\\n  the development of DES, and both books give a thorough analysis of\\n  DES. Konheim's book is quite mathematical, with detailed analyses\\n  of many classical cryptosystems. Meyer and Matyas concentrate on\\n  modern cryptographic methods, especially pertaining to key management\\n  and the integration of security facilities into computer systems and\\n  networks.\\n\\n  The books of Rueppel [RUE86] and Koblitz [KOB89] concentrate on\\n  the application of number theory and algebra to cryptography.\\n\\n* How does one go about cryptanalysis?\\n\\n  Classical cryptanalysis involves an interesting combination of\\n  analytical reasoning, application of mathematical tools, pattern\\n  finding, patience, determination, and luck. The best available\\n  textbooks on the subject are the Military Cryptanalytics series\\n  [FRIE1]. It is clear that proficiency in cryptanalysis is, for\\n  the most part, gained through the attempted solution of given\\n  systems. Such experience is considered so valuable that some of the\\n  cryptanalyses performed during WWII by the Allies are still\\n  classified.\\n\\n  Modern public-key cryptanalysis may consist of factoring an integer,\\n  or taking a discrete logarithm. These are not the traditional fare\\n  of the cryptanalyst. Computational number theorists are some of the\\n  most successful cryptanalysts against public key systems.\\n\\n* What is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance?\\n\\n  In a nutshell: If f(x) = y and you know y and can compute f, you can\\n  find x by trying every possible x. That's brute-force search.\\n\\n  Example: Say a cryptanalyst has found a plaintext and a corresponding\\n  ciphertext, but doesn't know the key. He can simply try encrypting the\\n  plaintext using each possible key, until the ciphertext matches---or\\n  decrypting the ciphertext to match the plaintext, whichever is faster.\\n  Every well-designed cryptosystem has such a large key space that this\\n  brute-force search is impractical.\\n    \\n  Advances in technology sometimes change what is considered\\n  practical. For example, DES, which has been in use for over 10 years\\n  now, has 2^56, or about 10^17, possible keys. A computation with\\n  this many operations was certainly unlikely for most users in the\\n  mid-70's. The situation is very different today given the dramatic\\n  decrease in cost per processor operation. Massively parallel\\n  machines threaten the security of DES against brute force search.\\n  Some scenarios are described by Garron and Outerbridge [GAR91].\\n\\n  One phase of a more sophisticated cryptanalysis may involve a\\n  brute-force search of some manageably small space of possibilities.\\n\\n* What are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem?\\n\\n  The security of a strong system resides with the secrecy of the key\\n  rather than with an attempt to keep the algorithm itself secret.\\n\\n  A strong cryptosystem has a large keyspace, as mentioned above.  The\\n  unicity distance is a measure which gives the minimum amount of\\n  ciphertext that must be intercepted to uniquely identify the key and\\n  if for some key, the unicity distance is much longer than the amount\\n  of ciphertext you intend to encrypt under that key, the system is\\n  probably strong.\\n\\n  A strong cryptosystem will certainly produce ciphertext which appears\\n  random to all standard statistical tests (see, for example, [CAE90]).\\n    \\n  A strong cryptosystem will resist all known previous attacks. A\\n  system which has never been subjected to scrutiny is suspect.\\n\\n  If a system passes all the tests mentioned above, is it necessarily\\n  strong? Certainly not. Many weak cryptosystems looked good at first.\\n  However, sometimes it is possible to show that a cryptosystem is\\n  strong by mathematical proof. ``If Joe can break this system, then\\n  he can also solve the well-known difficult problem of factoring\\n  integers.'' See part 6.  Failing that, it's a crap shoot.\\n\\n* If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable, then is it\\n  guaranteed analysis-proof in practice?\\n\\n  Cryptanalytic methods include what is known as ``practical\\n  cryptanalysis'': the enemy doesn't have to just stare at your\\n  ciphertext until he figures out the plaintext. For instance, he might\\n  assume ``cribs''---stretches of probable plaintext. If the crib is\\n  correct then he might be able to deduce the key and then decipher the\\n  rest of the message. Or he might exploit ``isologs''---the same\\n  plaintext enciphered in several cryptosystems or several keys. Thus\\n  he might obtain solutions even when cryptanalytic theory says he\\n  doesn't have a chance.\\n\\n  Sometimes, cryptosystems malfunction or are misused. The one-time pad,\\n  for example, loses all security if it is used more than once! Even\\n  chosen-plaintext attacks, where the enemy somehow feeds plaintext into\\n  the encryptor until he can deduce the key, have been employed. See\\n  [KAH67].\\n  \\n* Why are many people still using cryptosystems that are\\n  relatively easy to break?\\n\\n  Some don't know any better. Often amateurs think they can design\\n  secure systems, and are not aware of what an expert cryptanalyst\\n  could do. And sometimes there is insufficient motivation for anybody\\n  to invest the work needed to crack a system.\\n\",\n",

Basically it changes things\\n   when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's\\n   viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's\\n   actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to\\n   other users.\\n\\n   The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to\\n   develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that\\n   resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting\\n   it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.\\n\\n   This release of the client software supports the following functionality:\\n\\n    o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)\\n\\n    o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)\\n\\n    o User Interface Panels\\n\\n    o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for\\n\\tfaster frame rates)\\n\\n    o Mouse and Keyboard Input\\n\\n   (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the\\n   PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because\\n   I don't have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)\\n\\n  Server(s):\\n   This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is\\n   provided in this release for potential world server developers:\\n\\n    o Transparent Client Management\\n\\n    o Client Message Handling\\n\\n   This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of\\naccepting and\\n   terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the\\napplication writer\\n   can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.\\n\\n   Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is\\n   what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:\\n\\n    o Server Selectable Extension Installation:\\n        What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended\\n        functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension\\n        initialisers you want.\\n\\n    o Event Handler Registration:\\n        When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback\\n        functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.\\n        (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)\\n\\n    o Collision Detection Registration:\\n        If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide\\n        some basic information to the collision detection management software.\\n        Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.\\n\\n    This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because\\n    the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects\\n    from which to choose.\\n\\n    The following is all you need to make a World Server application:\\n\\n    o Provide an initWorld function:\\n        This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus\\n        any initialization you want to do.\\n\\n    o Provide a positionObject function:\\n        This is where you determine where to place a new client.\\n\\n    o Provide an installWorldObjects function:\\n        This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.\\n\\n    o Provide a getWorldType function:\\n        This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.\\n\\n    o Provide an animateWorld function:\\n        This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects\\n        move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit\\n        (to avoid outrunning the clients).\\n\\n    That's all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the\\n    three world servers I've provided:\\n\\n        generic - 81 lines\\n        dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the\\n                           stairs! Will probably be improved with future\\n                           versions)\\n        dogfight - 72 lines\\n\\nLocation:\\n\\n   This software is located at the following site:\\n   ftp.u.washington.edu\\n\\n   Directory:\\n   pub/virtual-worlds\\n\\n   File:\\n   multiverse-1.0.2.tar.Z\\n\\nFutures:\\n\\n   Client:\\n\\n    o Texture mapping.\\n\\n    o More realistic rendering: i.e. Z-Buffering (or similar), Gouraud shading\\n\\n    o HMD support.\\n\\n    o Etc, etc....\\n\\n   Server:\\n\\n    o Physical Modelling (gravity, friction etc).\\n\\n    o Enhanced Object Management/Interaction\\n\\n    o Etc, etc....\\n\\n   Both:\\n\\n    o Improved Comms!!!\\n\\nI hope this provides people with a good understanding of the Multiverse\\nsoftware,\\nunfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation, and I'm not sure\\nwhether that will ever be able to be rectified! :-(\\n\\nI hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of\\nthe Virtual Universe - I've certainly found fascinating developing it, and I\\nwould *LOVE* to add support for the PowerGlove...and an HMD :-)!!\\n\\nFinally one major disclaimer:\\n\\nThis is totally amateur code.

I recieved in the mail today the spec sheets on the mil.\\nspec version of Exar's XR-2240 timer/counter chip. It is stable down to -50 C\\nand sucks very little power. They show an application for a ultra-long time\\ndelay (up to several years depending on the RC time constant). In this\\napplication, they have two of them cascaded together. The reset and trigger\\npins of both chips are tied together and the timebase of the second chip is\\ndisabled. In this configuration, the output is high when the system is reset.\\nWhen triggered, the output goes low and stays that way for a total of 65,536 x\\nthe timing cycle of the first chip. The total timing cycle of the two chips can\\nbe programmed from To = 256 x R x C to 65,536 x R x C in 256 steps by selecting\\nany combination of the counter outputs to the timer output. The beauty of it\\nis, the timebase chip would only have to have a 100uF timing cap and a 391K\\nresistor for 39.1 seconds per timing cycle. So I can get a maximum of\\n2,562,457.6 seconds between timing cycles (39.1 x 65,536 or about 29 days !)\\nOf course, that's much more than I need (14 days). But the counter allows for\\n256 binary steps that can be selected for the output for the 'pellet puker'.\\nAfter the first 14 days and it trips, it would reset its self for the next 14\\nday timing cycle and so forth.\\n\\nPower is still a problem though. A few ideas that you suggested was to bury the\\nelectronics in a hole dug in the snow (as an insulator) and put the pellet\\npuker up on a tower above the estimated snow fall with a solar panel on it to\\nkeep a charge on a lithium battery pack. I like that idea ;-) This thing has to\\nwork for at least six weeks for three samples and the gas valves are 12 volts\\nto spit the pellets out onto the snow. Anyway, I ordered the XR-2240's to see\\nwhat I can do with them. Should be interesting (as long as I'm not the one that\\nhas to go digging up the pellets in the middle of Antartica freezing my buns\\noff ;-)\\n\\nThanks again everyone...\\n\\n-=-= Wes =-=-\\n\",\n",

This is because it's like te PC AT hard disk\\ninterface.  The controller moves a sector to some buffer memory on the\\ncontroller card, then the CPU moves the data from the buffer to main\\nmemory where it's needed.  If IDE doesn't work this way, then it's not\\ncompatible.\\n\\nHeck, if IDE used DMA, then you'd hear all kinds of complaints about\\nISA bus systems with more than 16M RAM not working with their IDE\\ndrives.  16M is the DMA addressing limit of the ISA bus, and if IDE\\ndid DMA there would be trouble.\\n\\n(BTW, there are DMA-enabling signals in the IDE cable spec, but the\\nlast report I heard was that they are never implemented, because it\\nwould require a different kind of IDE adapter and different drivers.)\\n-- \\nRichard Krehbiel                                 richk@grebyn.com\\nOS/2 2.0 will do for me until AmigaDOS for the 386 comes along...\\n\",\n",

Your 2F2 cap\\nwill have been designed as a RAM battery substitute, rather than for use in\\napplications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current. Their\\nperformance, in some respects, is more akin to batteries than to a normal cap.\\nThe other point is that big electro\\'s are usually rated with -5%+20% tolerances,\\nso calculating exactly what capacitance you have (particularly when considering\\nthe cold).\\n\\nYou should be looking at designing a micropower oscillator and divider chain,\\nthat \"rolls over\" (from zero to maximum count, or vice-versa) once every\\n1,209,600 seconds. If you were to use something like a 110Hz clock, you would\\nneed a divider chain of 2^27, to give an error of less than one percent in the\\nfiring times over the six week period. Of course, you could trim the 110Hz\\noscillator to give you exact time, but the likelyhood of the oscillator\\nremaining exactly constant at -40 is low anyway.\\n\\nI would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing the\\nsolenoid than there would be in the timer circuit.\\n\\nCaveat - I\\'m not experienced in low temperature electronics, so I can\\'t\\nguarantee that this (or any other) approach is the best for inhospitable\\nconditions.\\n\\nJohnH\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n      |  _  |_   _   |_|  _   _|  _|              Electronics Department\\n    |_| (_) | | | |  | | (_| (_| (_| \\\\/           School of MPCE\\n    ---------------------------------/-           Macquarie University\\n                                                  Sydney, AUSTRALIA 2109\\n\\n    Email: johnh@mpce.mq.edu.au, Ph: +61 2 805 8959, Fax: +61 2 805 8983\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n',\n",

Sophisticated\\nencryption can have this effect in the United States.  When\\nexported abroad, it can be used to thwart foreign intelligence\\nactivities critical to our national interests.  In the past, it has\\nbeen possible to preserve a government capability to conduct\\nelectronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law\\nenforcement and national security interests, while at the same time\\nprotecting the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens.  As\\nencryption technology improves, doing so will require new,\\ninnovative approaches.\\n\\nIn the area of communications encryption, the U. S. Government has\\ndeveloped a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through\\nencryption that is substantially more robust than the current\\ngovernment standard, but also permits escrowing of the keys needed\\nto unlock the encryption.  The system for the escrowing of keys\\nwill allow the government to gain access to encrypted information\\nonly with appropriate legal authorization.\\n\\nTo assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collect\\nand decrypt, under legal authority, electronically transmitted\\ninformation, I hereby direct the following action to be taken:\\n\\nINSTALLATION OF GOVERNMENT-DEVELOPED MICROCIRCUITS\\n\\nThe Attorney General of the United States, or her representative,\\nshall request manufacturers of communications hardware which\\nincorporates encryption to install the U.S. government-developed\\nkey-escrow microcircuits in their products.  The fact of law\\nenforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be concealed from\\nthe American public.  All appropriate steps shall be taken to\\nensure that any existing or future versions of the key-escrow\\nmicrocircuit are made widely available to U.S. communications\\nhardware manufacturers, consistent with the need to ensure the\\nsecurity of the key-escrow system.  In making this decision, I do\\nnot intend to prevent the private sector from developing, or the\\ngovernment from approving, other microcircuits or algorithms that\\nare equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key-\\nescrow system.\\n\\nKEY-ESCROW\\n\\nThe Attorney General shall make all arrangements with appropriate\\nentities to hold the keys for the key-escrow microcircuits\\ninstalled in communications equipment.  In each case, the key\\nholder must agree to strict security procedures to prevent\\nunauthorized release of the keys.  The keys shall be released only\\nto government agencies that have established their authority to\\nacquire the content of those communications that have been\\nencrypted by devices containing the microcircuits.  The Attorney\\nGeneral shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by which\\nan agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of such\\ncommunications.\\n\\nPROCUREMENT AND USE OF ENCRYPTION DEVICES\\n\\nThe Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with other appropriate\\nU.S. agencies, shall initiate a process to write standards to\\nfacilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted\\nwith key-escrow microcircuits in federal communications systems\\nthat process sensitive but unclassified information.  I expect this\\nprocess to proceed on a schedule that will permit promulgation of\\na final standard within six months of this directive. \\n\\nThe Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to\\nthe extent needed to preserve the government\\'s ability to conduct\\nlawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure\\nlaw enforcement communications.  Further, the Attorney General\\nshall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture\\nSuper Surplus Fund to effect this purchase.\\n',\n",

Compose a short summary of the function of the software.  Include all\\n   special features which are unique to your product and which set it apart\\n   from other programs in the genre.  Be sure to include specific details\\n   such as: the current release version, where the software is available,\\n   how much the registration fee costs, how much disk space is required, any\\n   special requirements (e.g. sound card, or VBRUN200.DLL, etc.), how the\\n   author may be contacted, etc.  Because text is highly compressible, the\\n   summary may be as long as is necessary, however, it is best to keep it\\n   short.  A good guideline is a single screenful of 12-point text at 640x480\\n   resolution.  Order forms and other such addendum may be included if desired.\\n   All submissions whould be in plain text (ASCII) format.  Formatting will\\n   be exactly as it is submitted - I will simply cut and paste text files\\n   into a Help Authoring system.  If you require special formatting \\n   conventions - such as boldface text or italics, or a larger font size,\\n   indicate so CLEARLY within the text file.  For best results, use Windows\\n   NotePad to create the .TXT file. \\n \\n2. Include up to 100k of Windows-format .BMP (bitmap) screen-shots which\\n   display the workings or special features of each program.  Special cases\\n   (rendering applications for example) which require 256-color bitmaps may\\n   submit up to 250k of .BMP files - all other should observe the 100k limit\\n   and use 16-color format.  For maximum compatiblity with the software which\\n   will be used to create the WSM .HLP file (Stefan Olson's Help Writer's\\n   Assistant for Windows), please save the bitmaps with Windows Paintbrush or\\n   WinGIF. \\n\\n3. Include a 16-color .BMP of the program's icon (.ICO file).  Many programs\\n   are available to convert .ICO to .BMP format, or Windows Paintbrush may be\\n   used.  The .BMP will be embedded in the summary text.\\n\\n4. Double-check for spelling errors, formatting corrections, etc.  \\n\\n5. Compress the .TXT file, the .BMP of the program icon, and any additional\\n   .BMPs into a single file using PKZIP (any version).\\n\\n6. Submit the entry by UUENCODING the .ZIPfile, and e-mailing it to:\\n   \\n   DAA7365@TAMUTS.TAMU.EDU\\n\\n   if submitting via the Internet or Compuserve. If submitting via America\\n   Online, send a brief message indicating submission, and append the .ZIP\\n   file, then e-mail to:\\n\\n   DiegoAA\\n\\n7. If any changes are required, or a new version is released, complete\\n   the above procedures again.  Send all submissions to the @TAMUTS address,\\n   and any comments, suggestions, criticisms, to DAA7365@RIGEL.TAMU.EDU.\\n\\nAll entries received before the deadline will be included in the subsequent\\nedition of WSM.  The editor will not be held responsible for any errors, and\\nwe reserve the right to make changes to the entries.\\n\\nWSM is not limited to shareware/freeware software.  A special area will be\\ndevoted to commercially available Windows 3.x and NT software.  Commercial\\nsoftware authors should follow the same steps above, with the exception of\\nthe limitations on size - the .TXT file and .BMPs may be as large as required\\n(and as large as is practical for transmission over phone lines).  There\\nis no charge for the publishing of either shareware/freeware or commercial\\nproduct entries.  \\n\\nAdvertisements for computer hardware, software, bulletin boards, etc. may\\nbe submitted as well. Again, the same procedures apply, with the exception of\\nthe size limitations.  There is no charge for advertising space.  The first\\nten advertisements submitted each month will be included; subsequent\\nsubmissions will not be included due to size constraints.\\n\\nWSM is currently looking for persons willing to devote the time to author\\ncolumns within WSM.  A C/C++ programing section, a Visual Basic section, and\\ntwo Windows-specific opinion/advice columns are envisioned.  All work will\\nbe on a voluntary basis.  If you wish to aid WSM and author a monthly column\\non one of the above topics, please send us mail at DAA7365@TAMUTS.TAMU.EDU or\\nDiegoAA on America Online.\\n \\nThe first edition of WSM will be distributed May 1st via America Online,\\nCompuserve, and the Internet.  The deadline for submissions is April 28th.\\nThe first edition filename will be WSM-1.ZIP, with each subsequent monthly\\nrelease continuing in the series naming convention (WSM-2.ZIP, etc.).  Each\\nedition will be released on the first of each month, and the deadline for\\nsubmission will be at least three days before release. \\n\\n \\n\",\n",

There is no much of\\nopinion on how good it is compared to the industry leader Stacker 3.0.\\n(Superstor Pro is not considered since it is slower than Stacker although\\njust as reliable - BYTE Magazine\\'s conclusion ;-) ), so it\\'s hard to make\\nany decision to go with Stacker or with DoubleDisk Gold v6.0. \\nHowever, it seems that at $39.95, it is quite a buy.\\n\\nBuddy Christyono\\nbuddy@optics.ece.wisc.edu\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nsummary of replies\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nHello Buddy,\\n\\nI do not have DD Gold 6.0 experience.  I just ordered it.  I currently have\\nDD 2.3 (the last version).  I am very pleased with its performance.\\n\\nHere is my suggestion...\\n\\n1)  If you do not have any compression software currently, I would go with\\n\\tDOS 6.0\\'s compression.  All the discussion on the net indicates that\\n\\tfor $50 you get the compression (built into the OS), plus the other\\n\\tutilities that you would pay way more than $50 for.  Besides, you \\n\\tare now at DOS6.0 (whatever that means...)\\n\\n2)  If you have DoubleDisk 2.3 already (like I do), the cost is $29.95\\n\\tfor the upgrade.  After thinking about it and asking the net, I\\n\\tdecided that I could not go wrong with the update cost!\\n\\tI have never suffered from performance of DD.  I have a 12ms HD with\\n\\tlarge SW packages in both compressed and uncompressed format.  It\\n\\tworks great.  Not delays.  I think the \"A\" is better than \"B\" \\n\\targuements are a lot of bunk... they are all comparable in performance.\\n\\tI am looking forward to being able to \"LOADHIGH\" the DD sw.  That\\n\\thas been an annoyance.\\n\\n3)  If you have Stacker, et.al. currently, I would not see it worth the\\n\\teffort to upgrade.\\n\\nJust my $.02 ...\\n\\nRegards,\\nMark Bagdy\\n----------------------------------------------------------------\\nBuddy,\\n\\nI got the same mailer. About 2 weeks ago I got DDG and installed it. The\\ndocumentation was, in my opinion, easy to follow. I used the automatic\\ninstallation (not the custom) and everything went smoothly.\\n\\nThere were some specific instructions on a readme file for dealing with 386max\\n& QEMM. DDG has an uninstall (unlike DOS6.0) if you need it. My system has a\\n203Mb hard drive. before installing DDG I had ~5Mb free. After DDG I had\\n~197Mb free. Pretty good statistics considering that my 8Mb permanent windows\\nswap file stayed on the uncompressed portion (along with other drivers and\\nsuch).\\n\\nI have had no problems whatsoever. I have noticed no slowdown (other than it\\ntakes a little longer to boot) either in windows or dos. So far I am a very\\nhappy camper.\\n\\n-Bruce\\n-- \\n  Bruce F.

Since then the game has never given me a problem. \\nThere was never any damage to the DoubleDisk drive.\\n\\tCompression performance for the whole disk has held steady \\naround 1.8:1.

These are equivalent \\nbecause of the way that it is 'pinned' on the SIMM board.  At the SIMM \\ninterface, they both act as 9-bit wide 1MByte SIMMS ( 2*4+1=9*1 ).

Why you ask?  \\nSimple,  if you understand why there is banks.  Assuming you have a 32-bit \\nCPU ( 386DX or 486 ), the data bus (e.g. the mechanism to retrieve data \\nfrom memory ) is 32-bits wide, so the computer expects to see 32 bits when \\nit asks for data.  To get that bandwidth ( 32-bit wide ), the motherboard \\nlinks 4 1Mx9 ( one bit is not data, but parity, so I will ignore that in \\nthis simple explaination ) to get 32bits [ (9-1)*4=32 bits ].  That means \\nthat a SIMM in a bank stores only 1/4 of the 32 bit wide data.  If you \\nhave a 16-bit bus, two 1Mx9 SIMMs are linked together to get 16-bit wide \\ndata, which is the reason why 286 banks are 2 SIMMs wide, and 32-bit banks \\nare 4 SIMMs wide.  If your computer required 1Mx36 ( e.g. 32-bit wide data \\nwith 4 parity bits, used in some PS/2s and ASTs ), you could upgrade by \\none SIMM at a time.\\n\\nHope that this message is not over your head, but the answer to your \\nquestion was not simple.

Well, who cares.\\n\\nFirst let me try to work out the facts that we get to know about the\\nClipper-Chip, from what Hellman and Denning were able to tell us:\\n\\nThe chip itself is not confined to (digital) telephony, but performs\\ngeneral encryption in a symmetric manner.  The chip supports CFB OFB\\nECB (and whatever the fourth mode of operation for DES is), the algorithm\\nconsists of 32 rounds of *whatever*, and takes 80-Bit keys. Input data\\nseems to be 64 Bit? Yes.\\nSo if two people want secure communication (whatever that means when \\nClipper is involved) they have first to agree on ONE secret key. \\n(Or is it one key per direction ?)\\nThey can exchange this key via DH-schemes or however.\\nSomehow the two feed their so won secret key into the Clipper-chip\\nwhich is now ready to work.\\nThe clipper chip carries an unique Serial-Number (30 Bit's), and 160 Key-Bits.\\nThese 160 key-bits seem to have been gained by encrypting the serial-number\\nwith 160 seed-bits. (The seed-bits seem not to be stored in the chip)\\nAt beginning of communication (and perhaps at certain invtervals whithin??)\\nbefore sending the fist real 64-bit output of the first encryption the Clipper\\nchip put's out packets (I guess 3) which represent the serial number,\\nand the session key. This might look like\\nX{ E[K; chipkeyK1+K2], serial number}\\nwhere X is a transformation of these 3? Packets involving a family-key.\\nThis family(sp?)-key is equal for ALL chips. (X might be a simple XOR ???)\\nAfter that, the (digital?) phone-call can be done as usual, every packet\\nbeing encrypted and decrypted by Clipper.\\n\\nDenning describes how K1 and K2 shall be generated, using a seed of 160\\nBit's.\\n\\nNow, leaving alone politics, which does not concern me as much as you, not\\nbeing an American Citicien(tm) [ :-) ] , there are some weak points in this\\nscheme, which might be exploited by several parties.\\n\\nAs far as I know about the generation of K1,K2 ; S1 and S2 look like the \\nobvious backdoor. They could be used to generate the chip-keys by knowing\\nthe serial-number (and also the family-key) of the chip. I really can't\\nimagine why these seeds would be needed otherwise, as true random-sources\\nfor the generation of the K1,K2 can be bought for not to much money.\\n\\nThen, the escrows. Each of them will get 80 bit of a 160-Bit key. Security\\ncould (as little as existant) be maximized by giving them 160-bits\\neach, which have to be xored together to give the K1,K2. Now let's simply\\nassume the escrows are trustworthy, and can't be fooled by criminals or\\nlaw enforchemnt agencies. (And there will be no quarrel between escrows\\nand l.e.a which would hinder the l.e.a in doing their duties, and so on\\nand so on) Once the keys are surrendered, the corresponding\\nchip is compromised forever. Not very clever, IMHO [ :-)) ].\\nHow about sending in the encrypted session-keys for each phone-call that\\nthe police (or whoever) want's to listen to? Escrows could then simply decode\\nthis session-key and send it back to police. (And would naturally not do this\\nafter the warrant has expired...) This would be a better technical solution,\\nbut I guess politics will not work that way.\\n\\nApparently (as Miss Dennings stated) the only one performing actually decodes\\nof intercepted messages shall be the FBI. Great. So local guys can not inter-\\ncept (understand) your traffic anymore. Does this mean that the FBI monopolizes\\nthe right to do legal wiretaps ? (How is law over there, I have no idea who\\nis allowed to tap, and who not) This certainly means that watched communi-\\ncations will be routed automatically from the service-providing company\\nto the FBI, if the communicaiton is a watched one. And this means as far\\nas I understand it that the family-key has to be known by each switching-\\ncompany, and those providing cellular-phone servies etcetc. So the family-key\\nwill not be very secret, and thus serial-numbers of calls will be readable\\nby anybody who cares. I _like_ traffic-analysis!\\n\\nWhat do you guess, what happens, if you use the chip in ECB mode, and the\\nfirst few packets of the chip are somehow lost or garbled? So the session\\nkey would not be actually broadcasted over the line? Hmmm. Shouldn't be so\\ndifficult to do *that* :^)\\n\\nAnd now a last point, for the other side.

The Earth, by\\nlatest estimates, is about 4.6 billion years old, and has had life for\\nabout 3.5 billion of those years. Humans have only been around for (at\\nmost) about 200,000 years. But, the fossil evidence inidcates that life\\nhas been changing and evolving, and, in fact, disease-ridden, long before\\nthere were people. (Yes, there are fossils that show signs of disease...\\nmostly bone disorders, of course, but there are some.) Heck, not just\\nfossil evidence, but what we\\'ve been able to glean from genetic study shows\\nthat disease has been around for a long, long time. If human sin was what\\nbrought about disease (at least, indirectly, though necessarily) then\\nhow could it exist before humans?\\n\\n>                             God created the original genetic code\\n>perfect and without flaw.

Only a very small percentage of microlife is\\nharmful to humans... and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby\\nconstant in size, but the ranks keep changing. For example, bubonic\\nplague used to be a really nasty disease, I\\'m sure you\\'ll agree. But\\nit still pops up from time to time, even today... and doesn\\'t do as\\nmuch damage. Part of that is because of better sanitation, but even\\nwhen people get the disease, the symptoms tend to be less severe than in\\nthe past. This seems to be partly because people who were very susceptible\\ndied off long ago, and because the really nasty variants \\'overgrazed\\',\\n(forgive the poor terminology, I\\'m an engineer, not a doctor! :-> ) and\\ndied off for lack of nearby hosts.\\n I could be wrong on this, but from what I gather acne is only a few\\nhundred years old, and used to be nastier, though no killer. It seems to\\nbe getting less nasty w/age...\\n\\n>                                                          Hence\\n>we have newborns that suffer from genetic, viral, and bacterial\\n>diseases/disorders.\\n\\n Now, wait a minute. I have a question. Humans were created perfect, right?\\nAnd, you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease. It\\nseems unlikely that Satan, who\\'s making the diseases, would also gift\\nhumans with the means to fight them off. Simpler to make the diseases less\\nlethal, if he wants survivors. As far as I can see, our immune systems,\\nimperfect though they may (presently?) be, must have been built into us\\nby God. I want to be clear on this: are you saying that God was planning\\nahead for the time when Satan would be in charge by building an immune\\nsystem that was not, at the time of design, necessary? That is, God made\\nour immune systems ahead of time, knowing that Adam and Eve would sin and\\ntheir descendents would need to fight off diseases?\\n\\n>This may be more of a mystical/supernatural explanation than you\\n>are prepared to accept, but God is not responsible for disease.\\n>Even if Satan had nothing to do with the original inception of\\n>disease, evolution by random chance would have produced them since\\n>humanity forsook God\\'s protection.\\n\\n Here\\'s another puzzle. What, exactly, do you mean by \\'perfect\\' in the\\nphrase, \\'created... perfect and without flaw\\'? To my mind, a \\'perfect\\'\\nsystem would be incapable of degrading over time. A \\'perfect\\' system\\nthat will, without constant intervention, become imperfect is *not* a\\nperfect system. At least, IMHO.\\n Or is it that God did something like writing a masterpiece novel on a\\nbunch of gum wrappers held together with Elmer\\'s glue? That is, the\\noriginal genetic \\'instructions\\' were perfect, but were \\'written\\' in\\ninferior materials that had to be carefully tended or would fall apart?\\nIf so, why could God not have used better materials?\\n Was God *incapable* of creating a system that could maintain itself,\\nof did It just choose not to?\\n\\n[deletions]\\n>In summary, newborns are innocent, but God does not cause their suffering.\\n\\n My main point, as I said, was that there really isn\\'t any evidence for\\nthe explanation you give.

This article\\nwill provide the essential information for doing so on standard\\nUnix systems.  A shell script and examples of alias file setups\\nare included which presently run on a Sparc 2 here at balltown.cma.com\\nfor a number of mailing lists.  Note that if you do set up an automotive\\nmailing list, please let me know of the -request address so that I can\\nlist it in the montly rec.autos posting.  Also inform the keeper of the\\nUsenet list-of-lists (check news.answers for this monthly posting.)\\n\\nFirst of all, to get anywhere, you need to either 1) be a sysadmin,\\nor 2) have some measure of assistance from your sysadmin.  It is also\\nimportant that you have reasonably good network connectivity; if it seems\\nlike you get everything several days after anyone else, or that you\\nhave trouble getting email through, then your network connectivity is\\nprobably not good enough.\\n\\nListserv:\\n\\nThere is a handy automated mailing list package named listserv, which\\nis available from several ftp servers on the network.  Details of\\nthe installation and operation of listserv are beyond the scope of this\\narticle, but anyone who is considering running a large mailing list should\\nprobably  look at listserv carefully.\\n\\nThe Alias file:\\n\\nOn a typical unix system; there is a file named /usr/lib/aliases on\\nwhichever file server is your mail host; it contains lines such as:\\n\\nfoo:   bar, baz, bletch\\n\\n\\nwhich means that any email sent the name `foo\\' on that host is\\nredistributed to users bar, baz, and bletch.  thus, the simplest\\npossible email list is \\n\\nmy-favorite-car:  member1, member2, member3, my-address\\nmy-favorite-car-request: my-address\\n\\nthis has a couple of problems; the most noticeable one being that\\nyou have to be superuser to edit the alias file.  however, you can\\ndo the following, with the connivance of your sysadmin:\\n\\nmy-favorite-car: :include:/home/mydir/misc/autos/my-favorite-car-list\\nmy-favorite-car-request: my-address\\n\\nWhere the file specified is a list of comma and newline separated\\naddresses.  This file can be in the list admin\\'s home directory,\\nowned by the list admin.\\n\\nBounced Mail:\\n\\nthis still has a problem; bounced mail usually gets distributed to all the\\nmembers of the list, which is generally considered somewhat irritating.\\nTherefore, the way that the driving school mailing list is set up\\nis instructive (Thanks to harpal chohan of the bmw list for this setup,\\nby the way.

       "  \"From: smb@research.att.com (Steven Bellovin)\\nSubject: Clipper -- some new thoughts\\nOrganization: AT&T Bell Laboratories\\nLines: 55\\n\\nI'd *desparately* prefer it if we didn't rehash the same arguments\\nthat went on ad infinitum last time.  That's especially true for\\nsci.crypt.  For that matter, I've created alt.privacy.clipper, since\\nthe traffic is appearing in *many* different groups right now.\\n\\nI'm going to focus here on some technical aspects of the plan, hence my\\nfollowup to sci.crypt.  Frankly, if you're not an absolutist, your\\nfeelings may turn on some of these issues.  For example -- with an\\n80-bit key, simply splitting it into two 40-bit pieces is much less\\nacceptable than other schemes, because it means that if just one\\nrepository is, shall we say, overly pliable, a would-be eavesdropper\\nwould need to recover just 40 more bits of key.  I need not point out\\nin this newsgroup that that's pretty easy to do by exhaustive search.\\nA slightly more complex scheme -- XOR-ing the key with a random number,\\nand then with its complement -- would produce two 80-bit subkeys,\\nneither of which is useful alone.  That variant is much more resistant\\nto attack.  Clearly, one can get even more sophisticated, to protect\\nthe subkeys even more.\\n\\nOther thoughts...  Some people have noted the size and complexity of\\nthe databases necessary.  But the id strings the phones emit could be\\ntheir back door key, double-encrypted with the escrow repositories'\\npublic keys.  For that matter, they could do that only with session\\nkeys, and have no back door at all.  In that case, the FBI would have\\nto bring every intercept to the repositories to be decrypted.  This\\nwould answer many of the objections along the lines of ``how do you\\nmake sure they stop''.\\n\\nWe can even combine that with a variant of the digital telephony back\\ndoor -- have the switch do the tap, but with a digitally-signed record\\nof the time, phone number, etc, of the call.  That provides proof to\\nthe escrow agents that the tap was done in compliance with the terms of\\nthe warrant.\\n\\nI can suggest other variations, too.  Suppose each Clipper chip had 100\\npublic key pairs.  Each would be used ~10 times, after which you'd need\\nmore keying material.  (Not a bad idea in any event.)  This could be\\nused to enforce time limits, or rather, usage limits, on each warrant;\\nthe keys the repository agents would deliver wouldn't last for very\\nlong.\\n\\nI suspect that the cryptographic algorithm itself is secure.  Apart from\\nthe obvious -- why push a weak algorithm when you've already got the\\nback door? -- I think that the government is still genuinely concerned\\nabout foreign espionage, especially aimed at commercial targets.  This\\nscheme lets the spooks have their cake and eat it, too.  (I've heard\\nrumors, over the years, that some factions within NSA were unhappy with\\nDES because it was too good.  Not that they couldn't crack it, but it\\nwas much too expensive to do so as easily as they'd want.)  They're keeping\\nthe details secret so that others don't build their own implementations\\nwithout the back door.\\n\\nThe cryptographic protocol, though, is another matter.  I see no valid\\nreasons for keeping it secret, and -- as I hope I've shown above -- there\\nare a lot of ways to do things that aren't (quite) as bad.\\n\",\n",

The hint is in the proposal that this or\\nsimilar proposals are being considered for other forms of encryptions\\nsuch as data transfer, data files, and such, largely dependent on how\\nthis thing is accepted or flies.  I think one would be wise to treat\\nthis in the manner one would when (not if) it gets expanded to other\\nareas than cellular phones.  I think this is guaranteed to happen, if\\nthis proposal gets by.  Salami politics.  It has been and is used in\\nseveral other areas, it is certain to be used here.  Government is not\\ngoing to easily give up on the idea that they should be able to eavesedrop\\nwhenever they want to.  \\'Court order required\\' has proven to be a rather\\nflimsy guarantee.  If the case warrants, they can always sieze the\\nmaterial, and force one to give the key, or sit in jail forever on\\nperiodically renewed contempt charges.  So it is not denying the justice\\nsystem the information, nor the ability to lock someone up if guilty\\n(or refuses to divulge the means to access the info - this is not\\nprotected under the Fifth - one can be forced to perform ACTS that would\\nresult in divulging incriminating evidence).  So, blocking restrictions\\non private encryption is not preventing LEGITIMATE law enforcement - it\\ndoes make ILLEGITIMATE law enforcement a bunch more difficult.  Especially\\nfishing expeditions without the target\\'s knowlege.  Don\\'t give up the\\nright to be safe from that - that should be non-negotiable, and Clinton\\nand Co. know it (which is probably why they quietly developed this thing,\\nfiguring if they get it this far, they can ram it on through).  How come\\nthose consulted could be roughly described as \"us insiders\"?  They cannot\\nquietely IMPLIMENT it though, when they ban other schemes to ensure its\\nexclusive use.  Hence the nice PR document to try and reassure everyone.\\nDon\\'t buy into it.  Has government really earned that kind of trust,\\npast or future?  To be secure and free, one must keep government honest\\nand the only way to do that is to make abuse IMPOSSIBLE, not \\'unlikely\\'\\nor \\'difficult\\'.\\n\\n>But even so, the evidence would not be admissible, I think, unless the\\n>judge so ordered.  I think that even interception of the crypttext\\n>without a warrant would be illegal.   Cops can\\'t record today\\'s plain\\n>cellular calls and then ask a judge, \"Hey, can we have permission to\\n>listen to those tapes?\" can they?\\n\\nSo what?  One could use information gained by re-use of the keys (saved\\nafter the last case was finished) or other means (master key, backdoor,\\neasily broken algorithm) to find other evidence which, given to a judge,\\nwould authorize a tap which wouldn\\'t have been possible otherwise.  This\\nhas been the more common manner of abuse of wiretaps in the past...  For\\nlocal cops, this might be workable to keep them honest, but the Feds\\nhave a workaround somehow, BET on it.  Does anyone really believe\\nfor example, that the government will use a scheme NSA cannot listen\\nin on scanning for keywords - either easily defeated in realtime or\\nvia a \\'master key\\'?  I sure don\\'t.\\n\\nThis whole thing sounds like something to eliminate the need to use\\nold-fashioned police work to build a case.  In the past, eavesdropping\\nwas rather easy (with or without a court order).  I think the Law\\nEnforcement community has become a bit spoiled, and will resist changes\\nthat require them to revert to using old-fashioned detective work.  I\\njust find it somewhat surprising coming from a bunch that cares so much\\nabout civil and individual rights, that \"puts people first\".  The question\\nis \"put people first\" to WHERE?\\n\\nWith the innards not being revealed, how is one to be sure there DOESN\\'T\\nexist a \\'master key\\' for use by NSA, etc (so they can do their keyword\\nscan, etc on conversations they routinely monitor, without a specific\\ncourt order)?   Remember, the cellular phone limitiation is only TEMPORARY.\\nBet on it.  And so far I have not heard about police telling people that\\nthey have been tapped and nothing incriminating was found.  What is to\\nkeep them from simply keeping the keys on file for \\'next time\\'? After\\nawhile, they would have quite a collection.  Kept especially for folks\\nthey deem \\'disruptive\\'.  And if they get only one key, that would\\nreduce the search space a lot, unless it is an RSA scheme.  Remember\\nNixon years?  Need for court orders really slowed them down, didn\\'t it?\\n\\nAnd unless the escrow accounts are not government controlled (fat chance!\\nI see one ending up being under, say Treasury, the other under Justice\\n:-)) it could be worth some serious bucks to some folks to get keys to\\na competitor\\'s Clinton Clipper (or descendent when this idea is expanded\\nto be used for all non-government encryption).

The excuse that other countries have these restrictions is not\\nacceptable:  Other countries do not have our Bill of Rights and\\nConstitution (which the people, not the governments, of those other\\ncountries often regard with envy - what we have as rights they have as\\nrevokable privileges).  And if we expect to retain those rights and\\nprotections, we must not allow them to be gutted because we just GOTTA\\nhave this thing to \\'fight crime\\'.  We have allready have our Bill of\\nRights pretty much torn to shreds.  We should not permit more weakining\\nfor yet another \\'noble cause\\', instead we should be trying to repair\\nthe damage.  Our crime problem may have a number of causes, but \"too\\nmany rights and safeguards\" is not a signifigant one.  A broken court\\nsystem and poor police work are a much more signifigant cause as having\\n\"too many rights\" (disregarding addressing the root causes for crime,\\netc).\\n\\nBTW - those who suggest that this is just an attack on Clinton, believe\\nthis:  I would be going ballistic reagardless WHO seriously proposed\\nthis thing.  It is just another step in a gradual erosion of our rights\\nunder the Constitution or Bill of Rights.  The last couple of decades\\nhave been a non-stop series of end-runs around the protections of the\\nConstitution.  It has to stop.

The answers I received at\\nthat time\\nallowed me to get a prototype of my project working. However,\\nduring\\nthis process I have come up with new problems.\\n\\n1) There seems to be a limit of 255 characters for a DDE Topic\\nstring. Is\\nthis inherent in all DDE systems or just peculiar to MSACCESS\\nor VB?\\n\\n2) It is easy to query an Access database from VB using the\\nDDE SQL command,\\n(provided the above limitation is overcome by using short\\nfield and table\\nnames) but how is one meant to update a database?\\n   a) A DDE SQL UPDATE command does not seem to work.\\n   b) Initiating an Access macro using a DDE Execute command\\nfrom VB cannot\\n      be used because when the macro requests information from\\nVB using a\\n      second DDE channel the programs dead lock until time-\\nouts occur.\\n      (The VB to Access channel has to close before the Access\\nto VB channel\\n      is initiated, I guess.)\\n   c) Access does not allow VB to DDE POKE the information.\\n\\n\\n   The way I eventually managed to update a database was by\\nsending key-\\n   strokes from VB to Access using the SendKeys command. This\\ntechnique has\\n   the problem that Access cannot be minimised and it must\\nalways be in a\\n   state ready to respond to the sequence of key-strokes VB\\nsends.\\n\\nAre all the above statements correct or have I made incorrect\\nassumptions?\\nAre there any better work arounds to the above? Are there any\\nsigns of an\\nODBC driver for Access?\\n\\nBob\\nran@doc.ic.ac.uk\\n\\n',\n",

I\\'ve weathered attempted dog attacks before using the\\napproved method: Slow down to screw up dog\\'s triangulation of target,\\nthen take off and laugh at the dog, now far behind you. This time, it\\ndidn\\'t work because I didn\\'t have time. Riding up the hill leading to my\\nhouse, I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel (no relation to\\nthe Springer Softail, or the Springer Spagthorpe, a close relation to\\nthe Spagthorpe Viking). Actually, the dog encountered me with intent to\\nharm.\\n\\nBut I digress: I was riding near the (unpainted) centerline of the\\nroughly 30-foot wide road, doing between forty and sixty clicks (30 mph\\nfor the velocity-impaired). The dog shot at me from behind bushes on the\\nleft side of the road at an impossibly high speed. I later learned he\\nhad been accelerating from the front porch, about thirty feet away,\\nheading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road. I\\nsaw the dog, and before you could say SIPDE, he was on me. Boom! I took\\nthe dog in the left leg, and from the marks on the bike my leg was\\ndriven up the side of the bike with considerable force, making permanent\\nmarks on the plastic parts of the bike, and cracking one panel. I think\\nI saw the dog spin around when I looked back, but my memory of this\\nmoment is hazy.\\n\\nI next turned around, and picked the most likely looking house. The\\napologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt (cut\\nmouth) and hoped I was not hurt either. I could feel the pain in my\\nshin, and expected a cool purple welt to form soon. Sadly, it has not.\\nSo I\\'m left with a tender shin, and no cool battle scars!\\n\\nInterestingly, the one thing that never happened was that the bike never\\nmoved off course. The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike\\noff course, nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some\\ngut reaction to the sudden impact. Delayed pain may have helped me\\nhere, as I didn\\'t feel a sudden sharp pain that I can remember.\\n\\nWhat worries me about the accident is this: I don\\'t think I could have\\nprevented it except by traveling much slower than I was. This is not\\nnecessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area, but I was\\nriding around the speed limit. I worry about what would have happened if\\nit had been a car instead of a dog, but I console myself with the\\nthought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a\\nblind driveway at 15-30 mph. For that matter, how many driveways are\\nlong enough for a car to hit 30 mph by the end?\\n\\nI eagerly await comment.\\n\\nRyan Cousinetc.|1982 Yamaha Vision XZ550 -Black Pig of Inverness|Live to Ride\\nKotRB          |1958 AJS 500 C/S -King Rat                      |to Work to\\nDoD# 0863      |I\\'d be a squid if I could afford the bike...    |Flame to\\nryan.cousineau@compdyn.questor.org  |   Vancouver, BC, Canada   |Live . . .\\n\\n\\n * SLMR 2.1a * \"He\\'s hurt.\" \"Dammit Jim, I\\'m a Doctor -- oh, right.\"\\n                                                                                       \\n----\\n+===============================================================+\\n|COMPUTER DYNAMICS BBS    604-255-9937(HST)    604-986-9937(V32)|\\n|Vancouver, BC, Canada -  Easy Access, Low Rates, Friendly Sysop|\\n+===============================================================+\\n',\n",

Excluding the diamond star/mitsubishi stuff and the LH\\'s.  You\\ncan find bad stuff about the Shadow.  Try as I might, when I researched\\nthe Saturn, I could not find anything bad about it.  There is a great deal\\nof information about this company, just because it is a new american\\ncompany and it has created quite a stir in the automotive community, for\\ngood reason.  Much more than the introduction of any new model lines of\\nany established company.  I read an article, which had a sub-column, an I\\nthink this imprinted on me more than anything else.  Some big wig in\\nToyota said and I quote, \"We are watching them very closely.\"  Come on,\\neverybody grow up, the foreign cars, especially the japanese have been\\nkicking our butts, for good reason, the american car companies could not make\\na good product or support the customer the way they want these days, to\\nset in their ways, which is one of the reasons Saturn was created.  They\\nare still struggling because they haven\\'t learned yet.

Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this?  I\\nwill also check it out, but this is 7am Sunday so I did not want to wait.\\n\\n        The unit key \\n\\twill be generated as the XOR of two 80-bit random numbers K1 \\n\\tand K2 (UK=K1+K2) which will be kept by the two escrow \\n\\nThe unit key, also called the \"chip key,\" is generated from the\\nserial number N as follows.

Many classifiers achieve very\\n  high F-scores, but their results would not generalize to other documents that\\n  aren\\'t from this window of time.\\n\\n  For example, let\\'s look at the results of a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier,\\n  which is fast to train and achieves a decent F-score::\\n\\n    >>> from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\\n    >>> from sklearn import metrics\\n    >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n    ...                                      categories=categories)\\n    >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n    >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n    >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n    MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n    >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n    >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n    0.88213...\\n\\n  (The example :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py` shuffles\\n  the training and test data, instead of segmenting by time, and in that case\\n  multinomial Naive Bayes gets a much higher F-score of 0.88. Are you suspicious\\n  yet of what\\'s going on inside this classifier?)\\n\\n  Let\\'s take a look at what the most informative features are:\\n\\n    >>> import numpy as np\\n    >>> def show_top10(classifier, vectorizer, categories):\\n    ...     feature_names = vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()\\n    ...     for i, category in enumerate(categories):\\n    ...         top10 = np.argsort(classifier.coef_[i])[-10:]\\n    ...         print(\"%s: %s\" % (category, \" \".join(feature_names[top10])))\\n    ...\\n    >>> show_top10(clf, vectorizer, newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n    alt.atheism: edu it and in you that is of to the\\n    comp.graphics: edu in graphics it is for and of to the\\n    sci.space: edu it that is in and space to of the\\n    talk.religion.misc: not it you in is that and to of the\\n\\n\\n  You can now see many things that these features have overfit to:\\n\\n  - Almost every group is distinguished by whether headers such as\\n    ``NNTP-Posting-Host:`` and ``Distribution:`` appear more or less often.\\n  - Another significant feature involves whether the sender is affiliated with\\n    a university, as indicated either by their headers or their signature.\\n  - The word \"article\" is a significant feature, based on how often people quote\\n    previous posts like this: \"In article [article ID], [name] <[e-mail address]>\\n    wrote:\"\\n  - Other features match the names and e-mail addresses of particular people who\\n    were posting at the time.\\n\\n  With such an abundance of clues that distinguish newsgroups, the classifiers\\n  barely have to identify topics from text at all, and they all perform at the\\n  same high level.\\n\\n  For this reason, the functions that load 20 Newsgroups data provide a\\n  parameter called **remove**, telling it what kinds of information to strip out\\n  of each file. **remove** should be a tuple containing any subset of\\n  ``(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``, telling it to remove headers, signature\\n  blocks, and quotation blocks respectively.\\n\\n    >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n    ...                                      remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n    ...                                      categories=categories)\\n    >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n    >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n    >>> metrics.f1_score(pred, newsgroups_test.target, average=\\'macro\\')\\n    0.77310...\\n\\n  This classifier lost over a lot of its F-score, just because we removed\\n  metadata that has little to do with topic classification.\\n  It loses even more if we also strip this metadata from the training data:\\n\\n    >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n    ...                                       remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n    ...                                       categories=categories)\\n    >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n    >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n    >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n    MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n    >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n    >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n    >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n    0.76995...\\n\\n  Some other classifiers cope better with this harder version of the task. Try the\\n  :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_plot_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py`\\n  example with and without the `remove` option to compare the results.\\n\\n.. rubric:: Data Considerations\\n\\nThe Cleveland Indians is a major league baseball team based in Cleveland,\\nOhio, USA. In December 2020, it was reported that \"After several months of\\ndiscussion sparked by the death of George Floyd and a national reckoning over\\nrace and colonialism, the Cleveland Indians have decided to change their\\nname.\" Team owner Paul Dolan \"did make it clear that the team will not make\\nits informal nickname -- the Tribe -- its new team name.\" \"It\\'s not going to\\nbe a half-step away from the Indians,\" Dolan said.\"We will not have a Native\\nAmerican-themed name.\"\\n\\nhttps://www.mlb.com/news/cleveland-indians-team-name-change\\n\\n.. rubric:: Recommendation\\n\\n- When evaluating text classifiers on the 20 Newsgroups data, you\\n  should strip newsgroup-related metadata. In scikit-learn, you can do this\\n  by setting ``remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``. The F-score will be\\n  lower because it is more realistic.\\n- This text dataset contains data which may be inappropriate for certain NLP\\n  applications. An example is listed in the \"Data Considerations\" section\\n  above. The challenge with using current text datasets in NLP for tasks such\\n  as sentence completion, clustering, and other applications is that text\\n  that is culturally biased and inflammatory will propagate biases. This\\n  should be taken into consideration when using the dataset, reviewing the\\n  output, and the bias should be documented.\\n\\n.. rubric:: Examples\\n\\n* :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_plot_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py`\\n* :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py`\\n* :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_hashing_vs_dict_vectorizer.py`\\n* :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_clustering.py`\\n'}"
